# **Jötunn**: The Valheim Library

Jötunn (/ˈjɔːtʊn/, "giant") was created with the intent to facilitate developer creativity, unify the communities problem solving efforts, and enhance developer productivity by curating a library of common helper utilities, as well as interfaces and abstractions which aid with mod interoperability and networked gameplay consistency.

We have lots of features planned for the future, however we hope the ones we have implemented thus far prove to be a useful base and provide an idea of the consistency we aim to deliver moving forwards.

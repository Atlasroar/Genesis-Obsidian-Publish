# Persistent & Synced Configurations

Jötunn itself does not provide any implementations or abstractions for persisent configurations.
We do however respect [BepInEx.ConfigEntry](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/dev_guide/plugin_tutorial/4_configuration.html)'s, their various properties, as well as their [ConfigurationManager](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx.ConfigurationManager) properties.
Furthermore we have implemented a method of enforcing server side sync on specific configs via the `ConfigurationManagerAttributes` `IsAdminOnly` flag.

**Note:** `IsAdminOnly` is provided via JVL, not BepInEx.

**Note**: The code snippets are taken from our [example mod](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/JotunnModExample).

## Binding and accessing configurations

Configurations are defined by "binding" a configuration.
Refer to the [BepInEx documentation](https://docs.bepinex.dev/articles/dev_guide/plugin_tutorial/4_configuration.html) about configurations to learn more about that.

```cs
// Create some sample configuration values
private void CreateConfigValues()
{
    AcceptableValueRange floatRange = new AcceptableValueRange<float>(0f, 1f);

    // Add client config which can be edited in every local instance independently
    StringConfig = Config.Bind("Client config", "LocalString", "Some string", "Client side string");
    FloatConfig = Config.Bind("Client config", "LocalFloat", 0.5f, new ConfigDescription("Client side float with a value range", floatRange));
    IntegerConfig = Config.Bind("Client config", "LocalInteger", 2, new ConfigDescription("Client side integer without a range"));
    BoolConfig = Config.Bind("Client config", "LocalBool", false, new ConfigDescription("Client side bool / checkbox"));
}
```

Use the property to access the current value in your code:

```cs
// Examples for reading and writing configuration values
private void ReadAndWriteConfigValues()
{
    // Reading configuration entry
    string readValue = StringConfig.Value;

    // Writing configuration entry
    IntegerConfig.Value = 150;
}
```

## Synced configurations

We can sync a client configuration with the server by setting the `IsAdminOnly` flag on the configuration like so:

```cs
// Create some sample configuration values to check server sync
private void CreateConfigValues()
{
    ConfigurationManagerAttributes isAdminOnly = new ConfigurationManagerAttributes { IsAdminOnly = true };
    AcceptableValueRange<float> floatRange = new AcceptableValueRange<float>(0f, 1000f);

    // Add server config which gets pushed to all clients connecting and can only be edited by admins
    // In local/single player games the player is always considered the admin
    Config.Bind("Server config", "StringValue1", "StringValue",  new ConfigDescription("Server side string", null, isAdminOnly));
    Config.Bind("Server config", "FloatValue1", 750f, new ConfigDescription("Server side float", floatRange, isAdminOnly));
    Config.Bind("Server config", "IntegerValue1", 200, new ConfigDescription("Server side integer", null, isAdminOnly));
    Config.Bind("Server config", "BoolValue1", false, new ConfigDescription("Server side bool", null, isAdminOnly));
}
```

This allows admins defined in the servers adminlist.txt to change the values on the fly, however clients without admin have no control over this configs.
Every client connecting to that server using the same mod will receive the configuration values from the server.
Local settings will be overriden by the servers values as long as the client is connected to that server.

Changing the configs at runtime will sync the changes to all clients connected to the server.

## Synced admin status

Upon connection to a server, Jötunn checks the admin status of the connecting player on that server, given that Jötunn is installed on both sides.
The admin status of a player is determined by the adminlist.txt file of Valheim. If the player has admin status on a server, that player is able to change configuration values declared as `IsAdminOnly` as described before.
If that status changes on the server because of changes on the adminlist.txt, Jötunn will automatically synchronize that change to any affected client.
This unlocks or locks the players ability to change admin configuration.
Mods using Jötunn can query the admin status locally and dont need to rely on a RPC call to check the players status on the connected server.
The current admin status of a player can be read from [SynchronizationManager.PlayerIsAdmin](xref:Jotunn.Managers.SynchronizationManager.PlayerIsAdmin).

**Note**: When starting a local game the local player always gains admin status regardless of any given adminlist.txt values.

**Note**: At the start scene / main menu the player is admin per default. This means that admin only configuration can also be changed in the main menu but will only be active in a local game.

## Additional config attributes

Besides the `IsAdminOnly` attribute, additional custom attributes are provided.
See [ConfigurationManagerAttributes](https://github.com/Valheim-Modding/Jotunn/blob/dev/JotunnLib/Utils/ConfigurationManagerAttributes.cs) for a full list.

* Browsable: When set to `false`, that entry will be created but not accessible through the settings GUI
* ReadOnly: Only show the value but don't allow editing

```cs
private void CreateConfigValues()
{
    // Invisible configs
    Config.Bind("Client config", "InvisibleInt", 150,
        new ConfigDescription("Invisible int, testing browsable=false", null,
        new ConfigurationManagerAttributes() { Browsable = false }));
}
```

## "Config synced" event

Jötunn provides an event in the SynchronizationManager you can subscribe to: [SynchronizationManager.OnConfigurationSynchronized](xref:Jotunn.Managers.SynchronizationManager.OnConfigurationSynchronized). It fires when configuration is synced from a server to the client. Upon connection there is always an initial sync event. If configuration is changed and distributed during a game session, the event is fired every time you receive or send configuration. This applies to server side configuration only (i.e. `AdminOnly = true`). To distinguish between the initial and recurring config sync use the [ConfigurationSynchronizationEventArgs](xref:Jotunn.Utils.ConfigurationSynchronizationEventArgs).

```cs
SynchronizationManager.OnConfigurationSynchronized += (obj, attr) =>
{
    if (attr.InitialSynchronization)
    {
        Jotunn.Logger.LogMessage("Initial Config sync event received");
    }
    else
    {
        Jotunn.Logger.LogMessage("Config sync event received");
    }
};
```

## "Admin status changed" event

Similar to the event on configuration sync there is also an event when the admin status of a player on the server changed and got synced to the client: [SynchronizationManager.OnAdminStatusChanged](xref:Jotunn.Managers.SynchronizationManager.OnAdminStatusChanged).

```cs
SynchronizationManager.OnAdminStatusChanged += () =>
{
    Jotunn.Logger.LogMessage($"Admin status sync event received: {(SynchronizationManager.Instance.PlayerIsAdmin ? "You're admin now" : "Downvoted, boy")}");
};
```

## Custom config files

Only the default configuration file of a mod is synchronized by default.
To include a custom config file, it must be added to the SynchronizationManager as it cannot be detected automatically.
The file must be located inside the `BepInEx/config` folder to guarantee the same relative path for all clients.
This alone does not synchronize the entries, the `IsAdminOnly` attribute is still needed.

```cs
ConfigFile customConfig = new ConfigFile(Path.Combine(Paths.ConfigPath, "path/custom_config.cfg"), true);
SynchronizationManager.Instance.RegisterCustomConfig(customConfig);
```

Now `customConfig` can be used like `Config` in the previous examples.
Note that `customConfig.Reload()` may be called to initiate a config sync if entries are set directly.

## Translating the menu entry

You can provide localized versions of the menu entry string.
Please see our [localization tutorial](localization.md#localizable-content-in-jötunn) on how to do this.

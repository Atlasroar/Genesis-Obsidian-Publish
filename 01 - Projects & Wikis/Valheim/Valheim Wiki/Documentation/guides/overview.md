# Features
Jötunn is continually improving and we have lots of features planned for the future, however we hope the ones we have implemented thus far prove to be a useful base and provide an idea of the consistency we aim to deliver moving forwards:
- Loading assets into the game, including the process of mocking, to avoid including copyrighted content in generated plugins.
- Custom items, pieces, recipes, status effects and skills, along with a framework for justifying your own asset types in C#.
- Easy declaration of console commands, localization tokens, and custom inputs.
- Reordering of bones for character wearable assets reposition.
- Network synchronization of assets and configurations.
- UI system to create panels with interactable content.
- JSON integration with SimpleJSON.

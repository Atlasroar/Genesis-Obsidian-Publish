## Description
> Valhalla Gothic is a modpack created for King Gothalion. Gothalion was looking for a group of modders to create a unique experience for his community.
> This culminated in a group of modders acting as support, a development team and design team to create a unique experience for players in the form and style of an MMO.
> This mod pack will recieve consitent updates, support and development alongside a unique set of world maps for all players to enjoy.
- The mod pack is designed and balanced around an MMO-RPG style gameplay experience. 
- With the default players set to 100, many users may not find the experience overly enjoyable as many things in the modpack are designed to be taken on with 3-5 players in groups.
This doesnt mean that solo players cant find the experience enjoyable, just that they may have to prepare for boss fights and such over a much longer period of time.

## This modpack is in it's active development phase. 
> Quests, rewards, XP etc are not fully balanced or even implemented yet. 
> Quests will be balanced around [WackyMMO](https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/WackyMole/WackyEpicMMOSystem/)
Configs, Yaml's and other files will eventually be provided with a full instructional guide on settings, configuration and how to add them to your own server to get a near 1:1 experience.

### 2.3.2
oops left a mod in

### 2.3.1
## Modpack Update
* added all of blackstars build pieces.
* Pulled the server configs from gothalions server for all mods and added to the pack for any who may be wanting to sync their server configs. 
## NOTE: IT DOES NOT INCLUDE WHITE/GREYLIST	it would be improper for me to add DLLs and mods that are not mine to distribute.

### 2.3.0
## Modpack Update
* added treesreborn to help manage deforestation: https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/TastyChickenLegs/TreesReborn/
* added changelog editor by azumatt so that changelogs also appear in game because lets be honest, this is literally just me writing to myself : https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/ChangelogEditor/
* added speedy paths. this replaces Need for speed due to the additions by speedy paths to modify unmodified ground speeds as well which will come into play overtime : https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Nextek/SpeedyPaths/
* added passive powers. This will help balance the overall feel of the pack. May be changed in the future with other mods that fufill a similar slot. This also allows player end configuration for said powers : https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Smoothbrain/PassivePowers/
* added pathfinder. This allows discovery radius to expand or shrink based on multiple factors, pair this with some upcoming changes : https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Crystal/Pathfinder/
* Added finewoodpieces (unified). Adding over 200+ build pieces is pretty much a no brainer for server longevity, especially with only two new materials to gather: https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/blacks7ar/FineWoodPieces/
* Added Norse Demigods for giggles. Was going to add it in 3.0 but might as well work on balancing now : https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Alpus/NorseDemigods/
#### NOTE: IF PLAYERS ARE PLAYING ON ANOTHER SERVER THAT HAS AN ACTIVE WORLD PLEASE USE UPGRADE WORLD TO ADD THE NEW MATERIAL LOCATIONS OR EXPLORE UNEXPLORED FORESTS AND MEADOWS
* added odins food barrels. Good deco additions and functional storage: https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/OdinPlus/OdinsFoodBarrels/
* added cookie milks build pieces: https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/CookieMilk/BuildPieces/
* added majestic button by azumatt. Added links to the start page to join my personal server, join the support server, and donation links https://valheim.thunderstore.io/package/Azumatt/MajesticButton/ 
## changes
* Removed need for speed, was replaced by SpeedyPaths
* tweaked and balanced paths around biome additions and having a road network. better the road (paved,dirt) the more speed you gain. swamps now drastically reduce your speed. will be offestable in the 3rd AGE pack update (feb 14th)
* various misc tweaks on the server, added more wayshrines as the server comes to a close in a couple weeks so players can explore more.

# Version 9.0: Tech & Architecture

## Total Tech tree overhaul.

- Major city redesign to reflect the changes of tech.
- Cities will be designed with the new tech tree design in mind.
- Traveling to a city should give players a quick glance of the cities wealth, based on the buildings the city uses.
## Vendor list overhaul

> This will happen as the tech update progress through it's phases. Vendor lists will be redesigned from scratch to ensure that traveling for trade is viable and worthy endeavor.
- Looting balances and tweaks
> The vendor lists tweaks will include loot you can find in the world and more importantly, Where you can find it.

# Version 10.0: Dialogue & AI

Fundamental dialogue overhaul with massively expanded branches and variants

This isn't just "add more stuff in" to flesh out dialogue. No that'd be too simple.

Custom Fully Rewritten AI brings the world to life.

Much of the AI is being tested now. NPC's trading and selling. They actively work in their towns harvesting, crafting and farming.

These can be seen as base AI packages. They'll be used to cut down on problems across the game.

Everyone around you will react, talk to you or to each other. Some NPC's will remember you, some won't. Guards will ask for money if you constantly try to bribe them while smuggling. Or they'll let you pass if carrying a high value bounty.

Combining these two core mechanics into one large update cycle gives me and the players full control of how the world reacts to you.

Piece by piece this update will roll out and bring the world of kenshi to life.

I expect hundreds of thousands of lines to be written, if not more.

# Version 11.0: East Coast Worldstates

Reconstruction of east coast factions from scratch

New Worldstate overhaul as described in boron's own blogs.

# Version 16.0: Bounty Killers

Do you kill the bounty and steal the loot? Do you assassinate them for the full bounty? But...what if they can lead you to even better loot and gear?

Bounty system faction integration with more depth

Factions will recognize more bounties, they'll hand out more random bounties and they'll reward you or even punish you for other bounties.

# Full Release

## Genesis: The Warlord Update

Final Worldstate pass for all major and minor factions

Factions vie for power of the continent in a Guild collaboration to bring dynamic faction war to the expanded world of vanilla.

Every decision. Every relationship and bounty up to this point has meant something.

Something has awakened in the dark depths of the continent and it's choosing now to make a come back.

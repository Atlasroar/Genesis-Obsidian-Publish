TECH TREE

> [!INFO] Tech Tree Ideology Notes
> The tech tree should be simple to understand and should be broken down into the following categories which expand laterally <-> i.e. if a player starts at tech level one at researches Beds 1. they may end there bed research at tech level 5 at beds 10.
> 
Anything built by the player should fall into one of two larger categories "Camping" or "Base". The distinctive natures of these two larger categories should be apparent.

- Camping items can all be bought or built on the go. These take no time to setup or break down. They are low cost and low impact but are crucial to the journey. They require Manual labor and can be sped up by assigning more characters to the task at hand.
- Base Items are just that, items that are built to support the player base. They are almost all directly upgradeable as they are. I.e. stone processor 1 upgrades all the way to stone processor 5. thus allowing Players to "template" there base and not have to worry about adjusting items or rebuilding things.

> [!INFO] Tech Tree Ideology Notes
>Following the Core categories we have technology "Branches". Within these branches should fall, again apparent technology. These may be edited and changed over time with more complexity to expand what is researched but in general players should be able to reliably place what category they want to focus on. Decorative or superficial buildings should be relatively easy to build and cheap to research, relying on buying a blueprint at the appropriate time or investing the resources to unlock a group of decorations.

- Core
	- the individual Tech levels.
- Shelter (Buildings)
	- All buildings big or small will be in this tech branch
- Food
	- all cooking recipes learned or researched will be in this branch (includes fishing)
- Resources
	- mining, farming, manual resource gathering will be here, includes fishing
- Production - Industry
	- Processors, refineries, and crafting stations required to "level" up materials will be here
- Smithing (Tech 3 Onwards)
	- All unlockable Weapons and Armor will be here in it's researchable. Much of it will be blueprints.
- Electrical (Tech 3 Onwards)
	- Any buildings involving, lights, power distribution, power storage
- Robotics
	- Any Technlogical progress involving robotics, healing robots, advanced technlogical progress (advanced training).
- Interior
	- Almost all furniture should fall into this category.
- Exterior
	- Almost all large external furniture, roads, town markers, statues etc will fall here.

> [!INFO] Tech Tree Ideology Notes
> The over all tech level is more a designation of progress and may be the largest time sink for players. To progress to each tech level players will need to complete the core tech for each level. This will ensure that bugs due to progressing x and then y can't happen. This will also ensure that all players can progress when they want without feeling like they're missing critical things. Allowing a direct line of sight to the finish line.
> 
> Tech levels may be expanded down the line up to 10 if it so comes to it but for now will follow the default style +1. e.g. tech levels will start at level 1 and will continue until level 7. Thus giving a total of one extra level allowing for buildings to be further expanded out without the need to overwhelm the player all at once.

> [!Warning] Important
Tech levels prices, costs, materials etc will be adjusted with feedback over time from donors and then from players in general.

Tech levels should follow this general logic and price points:

- Tech Level 1: Default start tech.
	- Style: Nomadism/Camping/Primitive Tech/Bone Tech
	- Raids: Light or None in most areas excluding, cannibals, fogmen, and specific bandit factions who patrol their locations (skin bandits, southern hivers etc)
	- Costs are default. This is the base level. You will always start with this tech enabled on every single start.
	- Upgrade levels: 1 - Advancement in production and self sufficiency of the player.

- Tech Level 2: Primitive Buildings/Advanced Camping
	- Style: Players won't be able to build super advanced shelters but will unlock better camping tech and the start of production lines. Players can unlock the primitive mud buildings, crafting and gear, at this point should they want a more stable playstyle without outright giving up nomadism, This will also give a decent money maker from the get go involving pottery.
	- Raids: None or Light. Same as tech 1
	- Costs: Costs should primarily be an investment of raw resources, 25 books and 25 camping supplies thus aligning with tech progression and the current abilities of the player.

- Tech level 3: Scrap buildings/Advanced Camping
	- Style: Players will be able to unlock the start of the "Rebel" or scrap metal buildings from the swamps should they venture there, along with various other metal scrap based cities like ironhaven.
	- Raids:
	- Costs:

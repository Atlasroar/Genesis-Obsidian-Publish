-fixed cage beast backpacks. now has 90% reduction. also stacks to x5. This should make them MUCH more viable when playing as a trader. It should also help balance out their slow speed overall

-added polynudj hair

-added medicore hair

-added hairs mod by dateconchi

-added taxman relations plus by howls@themoon

-added direwolf mod by sethknight

-added mercenary fullplate by big tino (textures need updating)

-added gat style armor by tasaba (textures need updating)

-added swordfish weapon mod by ikahurula

-added RLBS skeletons (unplayable for now, need to write a quest and start for them to fit them in genesis) WILL be recruitable through adventurers guild dialogue

-ILA Skeletons: are good for hauling, lifting and building. They are a more tanky variant of the standard skeleton (all variations are the same). Due to their more refined "engineer" style they are naturally good with blunt weapons.

-KLR Skeletons: are tanks. Literal walking tanks. Given their much heavier and dense nature they only top out at a max of 40 speed and cannot be carried, they also have less "strength & dexterity" than other races due to carrying their massive bodies around. However these big bads can take a beating due to all the tech packed into their body. They even self heal while bleeding less! While head health may vary their limbs and body parts are all the same boasting a rather large pool of 350+ HP. (race is NOT meant to be viable except as a tank skeleton unit. Race may need to be edited further to help define this)

-SLM Skeletons: These guys are the opposite of the KLR variant. They're so light they can actually swim. However they sacrifice A LOT of protection that normal skeletons have in order to dance around battlefields medic-ing, repairing and running supplies. (once again NOT a combat frame. Fills the "medic" role)

-STM Skeletons: While sneaky and light on their feet, what they sacrifice for stealth, wit and dexterity also makes them much weaker than most skeletons. Their light frames prevent them from being adept at assanination and also leave them open to being one shot or bleeding out from their much lighter materials.

-added the small outpost "Ashi" (meaning feet in japanese), footmen can now be found here in VERY small quantities BUT with masterwork gear (making them "one off unique armor sets")

-added the village of "Ikari" (meaning rage in japanese) to berserker country. it's a broken down village serving as home for a future minor quest explaining the lore of the berserkers

-added sandagosa / impalers arm wrap / plated leather drifter pants to cloud ninjas (80% acid protection). Should stop them from dying all the time.

-added weapon level "Holy nation" for various holy nation citizens and soldiers to spawn with. This manufacturer focuses mostly on blunt damage with less cut.

-added new name listing through wordswap. /NONWILDNAME/ picks through a list of 50+ gender neutral names to assign to random NPC's. Assigned to critical NPC's who are too generic (Barman mostly).

-added new name listing through word swap. /BANDITNAME/ picks through 50+ gender neutral names ranging from many cultures and also from random word pickers "Limb Chewer" is an example. Some Bandit / Ninja factions will now sport a new name change. "Limbs the dust bandit" is an example.

-added the lost town of regret. This town will feature a rather difficult Mission before you can enter.

--Beta 7.01 patch--

-adjusted adventurers guild recruitment group to now run together. (Grouped) This should ensure that they always arrive together unless they die while traveling. This will cut down on costs.

-fixed a potential issue with an AI setup when dealing with the mercenary guild. The recruit squad had the potential to attack the player and other "neutrals" randomly.

-added coexsitence for OUTLAWS to shinobi thieves and drifters

-added coesistence for Shinobi thieves to OUTLAWS and drifters

-added coexsistence for drifters to OUTLAWS and shinobi thieves

this should prevent a war that may happen in the hub.

-added 100 relations to all factions with each other to further prevent this as well. note the above does not mean they won't fight. It just means that they SHOULDNT and if you leave the area they SHOULD eventually calm down.

-changed the police in ironhaven to the mercenary police as indicated by the previous versions change log (was missed in the change)

-tweaked regret. Some buildings ended up inside rocks

-rebuild sheer cliff again. it ended up covered in rocks with in most of the buildings.

-adjusted the intial "recruitment" price (when talking to headhunter in the bar) to 250000

-adjusted the character data in the recruitment process to reflect rarity. Rather than getting 4 characters of a race variation (x3) you will now get 4 characters of all RLBS race variations. [Instead of getting an st-m recruit (mk1/2/3 at random), a sl-m recruit, a klr recruit etc. you will now get a RLBS recruit (x4) that has a chance to be all race variations. This will ensure that the recruits stay rare as to not easily let players farm recruits]

-adjusted the recruitment dialogue to reflect the price changes and imply the dangers of getting the recruits from a specific area

-adjusted recruits dialogue to have a little more flare

-adjusted the head hunters base dialogue to now explain better why recruits are charging a fee

-added a generic citizen template

-added generic citizens to vains pass

-generic citizen will eventually be used in all cities

-generic citizens are of a "mid class" economic stand point

-generic citizens can shop for about 2 hours every day around the morning

-generic citizens earn 1500 in wages a day

-generic citizens have a max amount of money they can hold at 50k

-generic citizens with the above effects should now have the possibility of "saving" their money, which may mean greater spending splurges randomly. (meaning they may possibly buy out shops, you now have competition!!!)

-generic citizens now wear various backpacks (to hold their shopped goods)

-generic citizens will be all races except special skeleton races (this means they will only be skeletons mk1-4)

-generic citizens now have two variations. Morning and afternoon shoppers. they are housemates (meaning they spawn in the same building)

-Nomads Exotic Traders now spawn in more regions.

-Nomad Exotic traders are now called "Nomad Merchant (WANDERING - REGION)" to signify what region the squad roams in.

-Nomad Exotic Traders now sell specific animals depending on what region they are in.

--Dreg and areas around that region will feature "pack animals". Goats, antelope, garru, and bulls

--Desert regions (east) will also feature pack animals as above as well as skimmer nymphs, they will exclude bulls however

--desert regions (west) will feature garru, bulls and goats with the primary focus being on bulls

--flats lagoon, heng and regions similar (filled with water/vegetation) will sell all types of creatures (This includes ones without backpacks currently like raptors and turtles) the animals given will be "mostly" close to their region. I.e. wetlands will sell everything + swamp creatures.

--nomad campaigns to your base will now sell mostly garru with a chance of goats and dogs

-Farm vendors will now sell more "farming" goods for various types of farming. CROPS are and will be the majority of their stock but they will also sell tools, animal parts, skins and leather as well.

-Farm Vendors will no longer sell bonedogs and only sell garru and bulls (cattle)

-Farm vendors will no longer sell various backpacks and will only sell backpacks for garru and bulls

-Nomad animal traders IN TOWNS will now sell all backpacks

-wandering nomads will no longer sell ANY backpacks EXCEPT garru/bull bags. This however does NOT include "pack" beasts, which come with bags already.

-added direwolves to replace the wolves in okrans arm and hidden forest

-adjusted some buildings in brink. they were a little sunk into the ground preventing AI from getting in and out of them

-adjusted some buildings in admag. same issue as above

-tweaked catun so that the turrets have better eyes on the gates. this should help with animal spawns

-changed the interior of lab No.2 in arkdon. loot was preserved just edited it so the spiders could walk around easier

-added a new fake faction "assassination targets" this will allow crimson rogue targets and other "to be killed" contract targets in the future be killed without having negative repercussions of said Faction.

-fixed hanz having hanks heart

-updated squin and removed some extra buildings, should help with load times and to prevent crashes in the most extreme circumstances

-fixed vains pass and updated it completely with new squads, merchants, buildings and new parameters for guards and patrols.

-vains pass now has distinct districts, the shopping district, the residential/farming district(s), and a slum/hiver district

-guards will actively fight animal threats

-Adjusted twin blades lock up to be smaller and adjusted buildings so that they were no longer clipping with small rocks in the ground preventing AI and player pathing. Reduced the town radius as well

-adjusted rebirth squads and removed some buildings. Cut 5-6 slave squads but left in their buildings. This will mean more Slave cages available and more "prison guard" squads that will be able to manage the slaves.

-fixed the adventurers guild issue with them not spawning. created a fake town for them to spawn from in the city of Locke. This means you'll discover TWO towns when nearing locke. This will have 0 impact on performance or AI. It's just a spawn point for the recruit squads.

-removed the duplicated buildings in bad teeth. Adjusted the city radius as well. should allow those that want to play in the HN to base nearer to the city.

--7.0.2 Patch Notes--

-changed TODAI walls to Sohei, following how most societies architecture is known by the societies name and not their architecture known by the city name.

-added todai gate guards back

-added todai market stall right next to the main gate so players can buy the blueprints for the new Sohei buildings

-tweaked bad teeth a little more. Missed some building placements that were still bugged. General shop can now be entered, barrel blocking the door is fixed.

-added azuchi to todai dera

-added regeneration to the vendors of todai dera (for now) to ensure all players can get these blueprints

-added multiple roaming squads of guards to todai dera (temporary) to protect the "town" but mostly to ensure the vendors stay alive

-adjusted the roaming squads in the hidden forest. there is a small chance for roaming jonins to spawn.

-adjusted flotsam ninjas to have negative relations with wolves, wildlife, and raptors. this should ensure that they at minimum attack these animal factions

-previous two changes should help keep the direwolves from overrunning the flotsam ninjas

-Adjusted Tower of madness faction to > Insanity

-removed all "abandonded" buildings from BDC

-upped the skeleton residents in BDC

-Removed the gates in BDC. They were not needed and causing issues with patrols and incoming AI.

-Tweaked Krals Shrine a little. Added a platform for the shrine to sit on. Turned kral to now face Arach and the bug master.

--7.0.3 Patch Notes--

-changed the southern hive names from "hive X south hive" to "southern hive X"

-made southern hivers non playable again.

-added a new southern hiver start. Start = Southern Hive relations: +100 / Western hive relations: -100. you'll start off with 2 prince, 4 workers and 4 soldiers. Unlocked research will include all hiver research. - players will start at a random SOUTHERN hive village

-added a new western hive start. Duplicate of above but with western hivers. Faction relations reversed - players will start at a random WESTERN hive village

-both starts start with 20 stats

-the drones for both starts will start with 2 pairs of master work black hiver armor (that's 8 total sets)

-all characters will start with random shirt type for hivers

-changed hiver research to now require hiver notebooks. As hive notebooks are "somewhat" rare. This should slightly slow players down when it comes to rushing robotic limbs. This is not meant to prevent, just slightly slow them down.

-added a new start called "Confusion". I don't know where you'll start, i don't know what you'll be wearing or have equipped or what level your weapons will be, i dont even know what kind of bounty you'll have...i mean ♥♥♥♥ idk what kind of stats you'll even have. Good luck.

-REMOVED 3 lights in heng. Noticed it cause small Pathing issues for AI and the player

-Added the town marker back to the Gray Desert Waystation. Was removed erroneously in a previous update.

-cleaned up the Z9 skeleton (bad/good) values. Some empty ones were left from previous editing showing up empty lines when selecting said skeleton in character creation.

-updated the height and placement of the swamp platform in vains pass. as was noted some characters would get stuck underneath the platform due to height. adjusted all the marketstalls heights to match this change.

-moved the vainspass hospital a little farther away from the wall. the southmost wing was clipping into an invisble hitbox from the wall outside leading to AI and player pathing issues in the town and in the building itself. Upon intial testing these seems to have fixed the issue.

-adjusted the height of some buildings in vains pass. Not by much but it did also alleviate some pathing issues caused by minute height differences.

-filled the hiver huts in vains pass. these were not meant to be purchasable. The interior name for the spawning squad was wrongly named so they could not actually spawn.

-added raven rock back into vains pass with some added benefits to the surrounding area.

-removed a floating light post near old ironhaven

-removed frugal post

-removed flotsam village outpost. both of these changes made the flotsam represent to much power when they are meant to be a hidden ninja group who use hit and run tactics.

-added a random drifter squad to ghost village. this should give a slight touch of life to the town without detracting from the emptiness. While not high in stats the player may find a use for them should the need arise.

-repatched the azuchi armors and reattached the proper icons. They were either lost in the merge or not properly added back when file structure was changed. Merc items will still auto generate for now among many other armors.

-Updated Mountains dialogue so he is now properly recruitable.

-fixed the bughouse in clownsteady. the wrong building type was erroneously used to allow a house to be bought in the area. The correct building now replaces it. (If you bought this bughouse in clownsteady you will have to import buildings to find it replaced, make sure to dismantle any buildings you do have)

-removed cape saul from fish isle (Will be replaced in the future but the area is crammed with cities and is pretty laggy).

-removed claw. It will not be replaced.

-removed ivory. it will not be replaced.

-removed lilipoint. It will not be replaced.

-removed silver shore. Will not be replaced.

-removed all southern hamlets. Will not be replaced.

-re-added old outpost to cheaters run.

-removed the hydraulic knights faction. changed the factions towns to second empire. (Hostile)

-updated nublar and moved it slightly north. This should allow those who know the location to use the southern part of the isle as their base unhindered. I've also updated the town to include a power station by default - - The buildings in this town are MEANT to be purchasable and will remain so. (However, i do ask you do not spoil the location as i would like players to discover "safety" on their own.)

-cleaned up cheaters run which had some leftover buildings in it.

-fixed a spelling mistake in the winged beak ogre pack

-fixed a spelling mistake in the phoenix's weapon "the purge"'s description.

-fixed a mistake with the kirvis description

-fixed a mistake with the hiver soldier armor description

-fixed a spelling mistake with the hiver ronin helmet

-updated some buildings in cage. some of them caused pathing issues so i changed some level variations to hopefully right pathing errors

-fixed a spacing error in facility 0-13 's name

-as per gabes stream i changed the timer dialogue for 0-13 guards. they should now only trigger dialogue once every 2 hours

>-updated iron hq ai package for the gate guards. they should now have the gates open by default

-removed the double-wide steel road boards in iron hq and replaced them with single wide and redited their positioning so that NPC's and players can path properly

-updated locke and vains pass. removed farm shop and exotic animal shop

-updated settle nomads (shem) they now have a bar and a little more houses. The houses include more nomads and merc guards who will respawn. (the entire town can respawn). The town now also sells exotic animals (moved from Locke)

--7.0.4(1)--

EXPECT ANOTHER UPDATE TOMORROW (ROUGHLY 12 HOURS)

-updated the races for the scavenger faction to no longer include fogmen. they will still include cannibal skavs though.

-adjusted springs main HQ buildings and tweaked the fences and pathing. Tinfists main HQ is now inside the middle of the city (again), the secondary HQ is now along the eastern edge.

-added snugsnugs scrap storage mod. Double checked in game to ensure it works.

-added corpse furnaces to worlds end, should assist with AI being able to properly dispose of bodies.

-added generators to vains pass. Should prevent the player running out of power should the build within the town. Will be adjusted as needed.

-merged Player town settlers V2 into V1. Edited town settings so that the random camps only appear in shem and okrans valley. Removed heavy weather areas like BDC, burning forest etc.

-added patched player town settlers to genesis. (May need much heavier testing, was only able to test and ensure "compatibility" for about an hour)

-Settler faction is now "NOT REAL", while also having 100+ relations with the "nameless" faction among others. This SHOULD ensure they can be "punished" without negative repurcussions. (i.e. they attack your gate and your turret gunner shoots them in the head) AS STATED this addition may need much more tweaking to work with genesis but it "appears" to work fine.

-Removed the bar in settled nomad village. Placed the "guard" bar squads into roaming squads and changed how squads spawned within the town to further enhance town security without detracting from the "nomads" town feel. With Locke being so close it makes sense that the nomads would have the mercs roaming the area and or in the town.

-fixed the settled nomads (SHEM) village. They now properly spawn an exotic animal trader.

-adjusted rebirth resident squads. buildings now appropriately spawn correctly

-adjusted rebirth AI and overhauled slave schedules. They should now appropriately get in caves, work, and use items. Some slaves will still work 24h's but much much less will work non-stop.

-adjusted runt to be unique

-adjusted runts spawn range to flats vendors

-adjusted runts weapon type from ancient to catun

-adjusted runts animal strength from minimum (90) to maximum (200)

-adjusted runts age from child to elder (100% chance) (needs testing to ensure size is right)

-Runt still has a chance to not spawn so it may take multiple trips to find him.

--IF YOU HAVE RUNT, GET RID OF HIM FROM YOUR SQUAD AND THEN IMPORT BEFORE UPDATING--

-removed the last remaining reaver camp

-adjusted the infested village buildings and removed the market stalls.

-adjusted the height of several buildings in ironhaven. they should all be pathable now.

-corrected the assassinations target factions name. was misspelled

-adjusted the starving bandit squads to favor mostly blunt weapons. Increased the potential weapon list to favor more blunt weapons with more chances between weapons. They are still weighted very slightly to have cut weapons.

-removed two cut weapon types from starving bandits squad

-starving bandits squad LEADER remains unchanged. They will still favor cut weapons. This should make players weigh their fights very slightly towards targeting the leader early game to ensure they are taken out of the fight early.

-removed the duplicated cannibal head item, should now only appear once on characters

-changed the default price to 100 cats, down from 1k. This means that every town in game will only buy them for 100 cats. Will introduce a specific character at a later date to allow for an upcharge.

-replaced lady merin back in drifters last. she was unattached and removed from the mod. she has been reattached and replaced back into her squad.

-reattached the textures to the padded leather items (unsure what the issue was here, maybe a conversion corruption? Files just weren't showing up, were hidden files for some reason)

-adjusted settlers spawn range again. will now only spawn in shem (temporary. will be changed on V2 of 7.0.4 update tomorrow.)

-adjusted the weight of the farm shop to stop overlapping with lady tsugis spawn in brink. lady tsugi will now always have priority.

-adjusted the flats lagoon building weights and types. This should allow all squads to spawn properly.

-added 6 more adventurers guild rally points. This should allow them to spawn and travel "safer"

-added various "outposts" around the map at the rally point. There are camp beds and campfires so players should be able to camp outside of popular cities if they are low on cash. (will add more to shek areas in future update)

-added new HUMAN ONLY nests for settlers to "okrans X" regions.

-added mixed races back to various areas that are "safe"

-Players based around Nublar will find their base to be incredibly beneficial now.

-removed the bonedog pack. Players should look for the "armoured canine pack" instead

--7.0.5 Patch Notes--

-per advice from the community the wrap type shirts were removed from the starving bandits. They gave to much of a boost to the bandits MA and provided to much of a power imbalance for early game players

-added some lighting to the settled nomads village

-adjusted the adventurers guild rally outside of locke in shem. Despite the region triggers stating the area was inside shem region the giant ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ lasers from the sky were still burning people. so many lost adventurers....so sad.

-adjusted ancient vault 6's outside buildings. the overhead buildings caused random jerking camera of the y axis. this should no longer happen when looking from the north/east/west directions but may still happen when the camera is angled from the south.

-adjusted the admag hq squad. Esata should now spawn 100% of the time and yata (legendary weapon) as a housemate now has a semi-roaming squad AI along with extra guards.

-adjusted the holy nation HQ squad as seen above with ADMAG HQ. Rengo is now a housemate thus ensuring both spawns have priority to the building without replacing one or the other.

-adjusted the UC tengus palace HQ squad. Legendary weapons Vendor Kratch is now a housemate. Show allow proper spawning without issue.

-added Wildlife+ mod.

-started work with Elwo on working out Unique Animal backpacks for majority of animal types. (completely unique bags)

-changed where the wildlife+ bags are acquired. as with all bags they can now only be acquired in specific towns. (settled nomad village being one of the locations)

-adjusted the recruit dialogue for certain animals.

-reworked the entire town of string (again). They will now use the same NPC type in vains pass and be auto assigned the same faction of the town (String faction).

-added crabraiders+ limbs mod in.

-starving bandit leaders now have a 30% chance to have anywhere from 0-1k bounty

-added bounty chance of 10% and max 600 cats to scavengers

-fixed missing animation references for all skeletons. all RLBS skeletons should now use the proper animations and be prevented from freezing (they had no packages applied at all)

-added swamp turtle fix. Swamp turtles now have a stomp attack.

-auto icon on the crocuta and hyena bags seems to push the item out of frame. will wait until the community generates an icon that is usable and replace it with that icon.

-added new wildlife + races to the armored canine backpack. It should auto adjust enough to look proper on the new dog types

-readjusted UC cities to have more recruit lists and merc guild recruits (as was the case in vanilla). Changed the weighting of some bar squads so that some are less frequent and the "more common" are indeed more common.

-adjusted food barrel to accept (i think) all types of fish.

-adjusted some waystations and changed some of the ruined waystation formats so they spawn with better loot, allowing an "easier" start. (pretty sure im missing 1 or two towns that no longer have town markers, if i am let me know)

-changed the spawnable towns for the freedom seekers start. You will now spawn at all included waystations

-adjusted the inn in clownsteady. rotated and raised it slightly to change how buildings clipped through it.

-Drowned ruins has been given a total remake to give it more of a "sunken, broken" town.. Armor King says "Best armor in the world, No thieves allowed...for real this time"

added a vendor list to rebirth buildings as per @Arbuz_Budesh suggestion. The containers will now carry monk clothes, food, and various healing supplies which should allow an easier "escape".

-adjusted the holy servant to now re-include the holy servant rags. this should slightly balance out how the HN handles in total, Equalizing the majority of the holy nation forces to equally spawn with the chestplate or the rags.

-adjusted the "empty" rebirth guards AI. they will now patrol the town instead of acting like a cage warden. There should be a total of 8 of these guards. This should help AI slightly.

-removed various housemates throughout rebirth. This should allow certain NPC's that deal directly with the "slave" squads to act without a housemate overriding there AI.

-adjusted the empty rebirth houses to now only have one slave master. He should be able to prioritize his "building" in case a "full" house cannot properly adjust for the amount of squads in rebirth.

-adjusted various squad sizes for the guards in rebirth. most ROAMING squads will now feature less guards. This change will not affect guards who use turrets or have specific building schedules. This should allow moving around in rebirth to be a little bit easier.

-duplicated the lookout towers. 10 of the 17 towers no longer have roaming squads of dogs/holy servants and are instead just towers. This should help players be more mobile in rebirth once again.

-adjusted the "generic NPC - no faction...." Squad. They should now properly harvest and use the resources around the town. This should make them "viable" to steal from.

-fixed the friendly fire and perception training dummies, per @b0bisacat report. They all upgraded into turret training dummies and not there respective training dummies. They will now properly be upgraded into their own mk1 and mk2 versions

-fixed a name issue with the locksmith training box. MK1 was named MK2 and upgraded into MK2.

-changed the descriptions of training furniture to properly display what levels they go to before building.

-removed various duplicated heads.

-Fogmen & Cannibals now like all the fleshy bits and bobs. Even those of there own families! Brains, Limbs, Raw meat? It's all on the menu now!!

-hivers are a little more efficient with "waste removal" now. Be careful who you hunt bounties with though! There love for fish now extends to all types of fish. MMM Crunchy heads and limbs.

-readjusted starving bandit squads. All weapons will now be assigned as the back weapon. This should help properly balance the weapons. Starving bandit leaders are unaffected by this.

-randomized "lab ruins" vendor more. You'll find more useless items (indicating it's been raided and broken down over time). Increased various raw materials.

-randomized "ancient lab" vendor more. You'll find more useful loot here. Removed various raw materials.

-increased the vendor item number for the "ancient lab" vendor.

-removed catch

-fixed the hostility of the ancient distrubution center. attacking the skeletons would make the skeleton faction hostile to you. changed the resident type to be factionless which will default to the "ruins - ancient faction" which will naturally be hostile to the player. I.e. Skeleton faction will no longer be hostile but the skeletons that are meant to be will be.

-adjusted the frag axe names. They no longer have () in there names. They will have names like "compact" or "dagger".

-adjusted the frag axe dagger's weight. from 7 - 5 (12 - 10) KG. This should bring it more inline with how the weapon appears (this will affect damage)

-removed animal bag blueprints. animal bags should only be available through vendors now.

-removed about 30 unused AI packages that were duplicates or unfinished.

-removed 6 unused and unfinished dialogue strings

-cleaned up 17 dialogue packages

-adjusted the slave get in cage and flipped the times. (test) per advice from https://steamcommunity.com/id/margaen on steam in the bug reports section who tested the times and this seemed to fix the slave AI.

-changed ruka, kang and rane the giant into bar squads. looks like there may have been a problem using them as housemates resulting in them not being able to be recruited.

-replaced the new and older azuchi textures with ones adjusted by snugsnug.

-added red and blue azuchi armors to the azuchi vendor in todai dera

-added red and blue azuchi armors to the Machined Armour Bench

-adjusted the naming of "Azuchi Armors" rewrote the descriptions for the armors "hinting" at another faction being at play in repairing the armors that are in the world. (Azuchi Blue Armor = Azuchi Armor - Blue/Light/Dark/Red) ETC. This is in Prep for texture rework so players can easily identify what armor is what in menus when crafting it.

-duplicated both sets of azuchi armor. Light and Dark versions will be available to NPC's while RED and BLUE will mostly be reserved for the player unless an NPC is of importance in Todai Dera. (Crimson Rogues will still wear red armor)

-merged in Vanilla Azuchi re texture:

Vanilla Aesthetic Patch - Azuchi Armour

A Workshop Item for Kenshi

By: UCHIDA

Texture Patch + Additions + Added to the world - New hand painted textures. - Retextured to match Samurai Armour. - Retextured to match Dark Metal Armours. - Worn by npc's. - Sold in shops. Heft & Mon

-edited the file pathing for whistler textures, meshes and part maps

-edited the file pathing for MCA animations

-upgraded stone camp.

-expanded and upgraded southern stone camp. it's now much larger with many more slaves. This Camp should actually rival rebirth. This should also be more believable as to where the united city gets there slaves.

-some slave camps now have scrap resources in them. For those who dont like creating bases. Of course, this is genesis, Not some other kind of (insert insult here) mod, No reward without risk!!

-adjusted squad slaves 3-7, changed slave 5 to have a higher chance at southern hivers.

-adjusted squad slaves 3-7, changed slave 3 to have a higher chance for all skeleton types. rare skeletons are weighted at a much lower rating between 3 - 30

-regular vanilla skeletons and their variations will be rated much higher between 60-100 (only for the above squad). Greenlanders are still weighted at 1000% so skeletons will be rare, but this also leaves a slim chance for players to forgo adventures guild in favor of buying (or freeing) slaves.

-the hub now has some special resource nodes hidden away for the discerning user.

-the hub has been tweaked, theres now a much clearer path around the city. The 3 houses have been moved to the eastern side of the city.

-the crimson rogues have now moved to todai dera.

-fixed the decadent house in the grand bazaar

-expanded the grand bazaar market stalls.

-fixed a house navmesh issue in sanctuary as reported by @DREAMS

-adjusted the pitched earth tent templates in the berserker village.

-removed the stormhouse squad from the berserker village

-removed the shek kingdom faction from the sho battai hydroponics building (oops)

-change the tertius naming for the characters. They now follow the naming convention of the british royal order of the bath.

-removed a large house from swordran, it was replaced with a police station as suggested per @Nathraval

-removed "kingdom" armor types and replaced them with Holy plates of various types

-adjusted the fish isle fishman camps. they are now much more spread out. This should allow players to kite easier and work there way through the hoards. Thus allowing even lower level players and squads the ability to get to the alpha fishman.

-fortress of dawn was removed. (permanently)

-added krell fin back into town coral

-moved ancient vault 3. (it's semi close by, just closer to the mountain range)

-moved the lure and gale slightly north. rebuilt how both cities appear to "function". they're now nestled on top of a lot of iron and walled in with a mix of natural hill formations and large wall sets. to get to gale (the refugee center) you'll now have to get though the lure. Thus the homage to the cities name. (the old locations may need a little more cleaning but i think i got 99% of the external features like lights, campfires etc)

-added desert divers to fish isle squads

-changed the name of the desert divers to Fish Isle Heavy Merc

-removed sphere helmets from all vendors except scraphouse and fish isle.

-removed compression backpack from all vendors except scraphouse and fish isle

-fish isle armor will now sell compression bag and sphere masks. (this will be edited in the future, once the quest for regret is done. they will be considered "lost tech")

-duplicated black rag shirts.

-renamed duplicated shirts to "NPC WEATHER GEAR"

-will slowly add them to squads that have problems with weather. Fish isles,, black desert etc. This should clean up the gear format. Besides weather this gear provides 0 bonuses and has 0 coverage.

-trade economies will be updated in time to make owning this item illegal everywhere. (there are other options you lazy nerds)

-added NPC gear to fish islanders

-added NPC gear to black dragons

side note. NPC gear is a little odd looking with some setups. theres clipping. may need to change the shirt copied and use something else instead.

-updated cross dialogue. it now indicates that the weapons in the city are a large stockpile under heavy guard but maintained by the best craftsman of the world instead of being created there. This fits more with the lore of kenshi but still gives avalon the unique flair it orginally had.

--7.0.6 PATCH NOTES--

-removed rane the giant from the drifter faction. appears to be causing issues of some kind with her being recruited

-fixed ikari having no faction. Now assigned to berserkers like it should have been orginally

-fixed workshop complexes not having a faction. Now attached to old machine faction

-ghost village now has a faction "no faction". This should alleviate the bug listing in info.log

-changed direwolves weapon level from edgewalker to bones. (cause they're teeth and stuff.) Upped the combat stats 50 > 60 to compensate for the massive drop in damage. added a stats randomization of 10. They can now have a max combat stat from 50 - 70. Thus allowing a more natural feeling of age and aggressiveness that you would see in the wild.

-as per @Rem, Hive Rights Activist suggestion doubled the hiver squad from adventures guild. added southern hivers to the race list at a much smaller % than western hivers

-added custom stats to the onyx adventurer. They now have 0 athletics.

adjusted the skeleton recruits in the normal bracket. They're now weighted differently making some more rare than others.

-per another suggestion by the community made the adventurer guilds recruits all have baseline minimum 10 stats. This also has the added benefit of making them faster than the onyx adventurer which should allow them to keep up with the squad.

-removed the dialogue package from tengus squad. his Guards will no longer repeat what he says.

-changed the stats of "duck type weapons" used by goats (and were used by raptors). They now focus on blunt damage instead of cut and have a multiplier for blunt damage and skeleton damage (they're blunt weapons). Thus making them dangerous to skeletons

-opted the bone weapon level so that they have "much" higher blunt and "much" less cut. Thus making these the optimal weapon level for more "passive" animals like turtles, goats etc. and fogmen.

-renamed the intial "duck type" weapons to "_passive animal weapon"

>Animal Changes

-animal weapons and archetypes are now much more dangerous for the unprepared. Every animal has a specialty.

>Gorillos are now incredibly dangerous for those wearing less armor (or naked). (armor is 50% MORE effective against them, thus making them super dangerous for naked recruits but making them little more than a nuisance once about level 30 combat stats and decently armored)

>Beak Things now focus mostly on cut damage with a bit of pierce damage. Given the nature of there beaks shape and attack type this makes a bit of sense.

>goats and antelope now focus *almost solely on blunt damage. (tiny bit of pierce in there)

>garrus now focus solely on blunt damage but have more blunt than goats (logically they're bigger so would do more damage)

>bulls (WILD) now have HIGH pierce but less cut and blunt. Armor is also 50% LESS effective, thus making them extra dangerous if you piss them off

>bulls (domesticated) ...well they're just meh. (these are the version with there horns lopped off) little more blunt than a garru but slightly less damage overall. Just tankier than garru.

>dogs (of all kinds) now have high bleed (30% faster bleed damage), small bit of pierce and armor is 10% effective on them. Given the amount of types of dogs this makes sense. This animal mostly focuses on bleed, meaning coverage is much more crucial.

>leviathans are just all blunt. ♥♥♥♥ you, ♥♥♥♥ your armor, ♥♥♥♥ your humans and your robots, SQUISH.

>cage beasts and turtles are now high damage blunt but very little bleed/pierce etc.

>raptors now have high bleed potential IF you're naked. (armor is 50% more effective)

>LARGE spiders now have pierce, higher bleed, slightly higher cut, but armor is 30% more effective.

>Small Spiders now have high bleed. But not much else. armor is 60% more effective

HOWEVER, Spiders of ALL types are now 3 times more deadly to other animals. This makes them super dangerous for caravans or in certain areas.

-removed majority of the skeletons from distribution center. Also axed there stats. They now can only have a max of 20 stats rather than upwards of 60's.

-per @Vnlxv report changed the building type of the megaraptor to match the new building type used in genesis. (This was overlooked when editing the city) Also ensured the building is buyable. Thus you can either fight the megaraptor and buy the building or just buy the building and have the raptor(s) despawn.

-added some more resources around nublar.

-removed most "recruits" in swordran. replaced them all with the previously reworked recruits. (looks like there was a duplicate i missed when remaking the characters)

-optimized the cactus den.

-fixed NPC WEATHER GEAR to be completely Neutral stats rather than 0. This makes them have no bonuses or negatives.

-changed the compression backpack. It's now much heavier, is worth less (-5k). Athletics will take a minor hit when wearing the bag. Combat speed and skills will however, take a massive hit, as will stealth. In comparison the bag can "compress" a lot of items giving a majority of items a minimum of stack size of 10. Being that the bag also uses gases to do this the actual inventory of the bag is much lighter.

-removed hi-kers red and blue bags of all sizes.

-Removed the traders medium and large bags

-removed small thieves bag and replaced it will the knapsack.

-removed the cage beast backpack, this makes the other variant more unique.

-removed the (colored) and (black) variants of all bags. This will make merging Expanded bags easier in the future and will make all bags thematically fit easier in the world of kenshi.

IF YOU HAVE THESE BAGS, REMOVE THEM BEFORE IMPORTING

-updated the description of the knapsack to fit better in it's role as a "thieves bag".

-upped the combat penalties of the knapsack and lowered the thieving bonus by 10%. This will bring it more in line with "being useful" and not overpowered.

-thieves bags will no longer be sold outside of the thieves guild. Thus increasing their usefulness and the usefulness of the guild itself by making their items specialized enough to make players want to hunt these items down.

-added a new "canine bag" (temporary model). This bag should work on all dogs (i think)

-Bags will be re balanced around the assumption that they were created for a purpose. Smaller bags will lean more towards stealth and large bags will lean more towards being for traders. Medium bags will be general all around purpose bags. More bags may be removed/replaced in the future depending on player feedback

-deleted reaver camps...again >,>

-changed how the sohei gate guard housemates spawn. They're will now be less guards overall. though should still be enough to rotate throughout the empty space and attack hostiles.

-adjusted the max and minimum amounts of blood spiders that can spawn in the burning forest. This should help balance the region a little more with the up coming changes. There are less spiders overall regardless of squad size which should prevent just straight up animal annihilation when walking through the region

-added vendors to the swamp ninja base so that they now have proper loot as reported by @iovetap

-adjusted ancient vault 3 - s building as reported by @Mobile Kek Suit & @Samuel . Overlooked the town placement last patch

-adjusted the cannibal weapon manufacturers stats and the weapons themselves. Most do decent bleed damage but now properly take into account armor resistances. More armor, less worry. Except for the meat hammer...that thing will ♥♥♥♥ you up with armor, ESPECIALLY skeletons.

-removed various weapon manufacturers to re-balance stats appropriately across weapons. (some weapon rewards were wildly unbalanced even compared to cannibal weapons).

-changed the naming conventions on some weapon manufacturers and some descriptions. making them easier to understand and read as well as giving a little more insight into kenshi lore

-fixed the pearl barmans dialogue as reported by @Randomlollis . Looks like it had a duplicated dialogue tree from the black desert barman.

-fixed crixus and edited his stats. he now has generic recruitment dialouge instead of having an identity crisis as reported by @Iblis

-updated the arbiters dialogue. and his recruitment price

>Global Settings Changes

-changed global XP multipliers again. Was 3 > 2.5 - Is now 2.5 > 2

-changed blunt permanent damage percentage slightly. 0 > .09

-changed intial bow damage multiplier for shoddy gear. 1.1 > 1

-changed intial bow damage multiplier for master gear. 1.3 > 1.2

-tweaked build speed. 6 > 5. (slightly slower build speed.)

-changed medic usage lvl 1. - 20 > 40

-changed medic usage lvl 99 - 1 > 10 / Medic changes should make them much more worthwhile of producing, buying and keeping on hand.

-changed resting heal rate. 2 > 2.2. This makes sleeping in beds and rolls more worthwhile without completely devaluing on hand medkits

-robot wear rate increased. 1 > 1.5. Thus making skeletons harder to upkeep overall

-changed bleeding clot rate. .0085 > .0095 (while not a massive change this should help early game a little more)

-changed blood recovery rate. 0.4 > 0.35 (once again not a huge change but still notable)

-body degeneration rate changed. 1.5 > 1.6

-degeneration lvl 99 changed. .005 > .01 (this should balance toughness a little more while making armor prep more relevant, without the need to micromanage armor)

-changed max toughness KO point. 80 > 95. Being tough should be it's own reward. As such this balance makes it so you can fight just a little longer, or heal for a little longer before you go down.

-carry person weight from 30 > 85

-skill diff xp 0X mult from 20 > 35 (this means you can be up to 35 levels stronger than someone and still gain experience, this has a side effect of allowing players to "safely" level til about level 50 ish in the borderzone)

-global toughness xp from 1.33 > 1.25. This makes fighting overall harder but more rewarding without simply slapping the player in the face and saying no.

-added NPC weather gear to cloud ninjas

-added various mask types to the cloud ninja (the shirt will protect them for sure but the head gear variation should be nice enough for people to want to steal from them)

-removed the impalers arm wrap from the cloud ninja (was only on them temporarily)

-adjusted the cloud ninjas weapons. they can now mix and match various katanas, not just ninja blades.

-adjusted south hive start. each character now has gear individually and changed the level to good gear instead of masterwork - readded the praetorian to the squad and made it the leader.

-adjusted the western hive start. same as above

-added the category patch for genesis IMPORT WITHOUT TECH

-added the more dogs mod by @William .

More Dogs

A Workshop Item for Kenshi

By: Hoser

This mod aims to add greater diversity to the canine species of Kenshi. To this end it adds a total of 13 new canine species. 11 of the 13 species are wild animals and can be found roaming in nature.

Will use this mod to provide more dog variety in bosses and enemy factions like rizzos rats and the bonepack as well as various bits of gear for said factions to wear.

-changed the "guy with hyenas" start. Now has a chance to include 1-5 hyenas and one of each type added by the wildlife mod. (Guaranteed at least one). Also added more start locations to the start. You can now spawn in most major cities.

-added and merged jewys limb overhaul

-Under heavy thought, all tech to create unique NPC arms was removed. This makes them powerful items worth having but also makes them completely unique and trophy items as well as heavy boons for the player which should increase the overall worth of the item.

Changes to arm stats (applies for both arms). These changes are intended to bring a little more balance to the arms so that they can find there place in the world of kenshi and serve their INTENDED purpose as arms. Not all limbs are strong, not all are fast. Each limb now has proper debuffs as recommended by a lot of users. Almost all descriptions have been updated and partially rewritten to further explain (to a small extent) a "lore" reason as to why certain things have differing stats.

Certain Features have also been PURPOSEFULLY overlooked (like arm/leg weights) This should mod focuses mostly on providing more choices to work with but not more things to "think" about.

-Thiefs arm - Health(1) 150 > 100 / Dex Mult(1) - 1.2 > 1.15 / Thievery mult(1) 1.25 > 1.35 / strength mult(1) 1 > 0.75 This should help the thieves arm be more about thieving and less a combo arm.

-Swift arm MK3 - Health(1) 200 > 90 / Dex Mult(1) 1.7 > 1.5 / stength mult(0/1) (.9/1) > 0.5 / Thievery mult (0/1) (.9/1) > .9

-Swift Arm MK2 - Health(1) 175 > 130 / Dex Mult 1.55 > 1.3 / strength(0/1) > 0.6 / thievery mult (0/1) > .9

-Swift Arm MK1 - health(1) 150 > 120 / dex mult 1.4 > 1.15 / strength(0/1) > 0.8 / stealth mult(0/1) > 0.7

-stealth leg - athletics(1) - 1.05 > 0.9 / Stealth Mult(1) 1.2 > 1.3

-steady arm - dex mult(1) 1.2 > 1.1 / ranged mult(1) 1.25 > 1.35 / Strength mult(1) > 0.75

-skele legs - athletics(1) 1.1 > 1.15

-skele arms - dex mult(1) 1.25 > 1.05

-shadows leg - stats duplicated to match stealth leg / stealth mult > 1.5

-scout leg - unchanged

-power arm MK3 - health 100/200 / swimming mult(1) 1 > 0.9 / weight 20 > 35 / flat reduction to all mult not strength (X) > 0.5 / strength(1) 1.5 > 1.8

-power arm MK2 - health 100/175 / flat 0.5 stat multipliers / strength mult(1) 1.55 > 1.5

-power arm MK1 - health 100/150 / flat 0.5 stat multipliers / strength mult(1) 1.35 > 1.25

-Marksmans Arm - Removed

-leviathans legs - weight 30 > 45 / health 150/400 / swimming 0.1 / athletics 0.9 / stealth 0.1

-leviathan legs - weight 15 > 20 / health 115/300 / swimming 0.1 / stat mult 0.1 / strength 1/1 > 1/2

-KLR legs - health 100/200

-KLR Arms - health 100/200 / dev mult(1) 1.1 > 1 / ranged mult(1) X > .75

-lifter arms - dex mult(1) 1 > 0.9 / ranged mult 0.2 / strength mult(1) 1.25 > 1.3 / thievery mult 0.9 > 0.1

-Gutters leg - swimming mult(1) 1 > 0.9 / athletics 1.6 > 1.55

-economy legs - unchanged

-berserkers legs - athletics(1) 1.1 > 1

-bandits arms - weight 10 > 5 / dex mult(1) 1.2 > 1.15 / strength flat 0.75 / theivery 1.3 > 1.4

-added BDC relics mod finally

BDC legs - health 160-250 / swimming 0.9-1.05 / athletics 0.9-1.15 / stealth 0.9-1

BDC arms - health 150-250 / swimming .95-1.05 / dex-range-strength-thievery 0.9-1.15

These limbs are NOT craftable, are only available in the scraphouse SUPER rarely, are SUPER expensive, as they cannot be crafted, and are a perfect upgrade to anyones limbs.

-removed all the gutter items from being craftable. they're now properly unique, safe with gutterhead

-added irkuhulas iron spider arm limb mod

security spider arms - health 75/125 / swimming 0.55 / unarmed 1/10 / stats flat 0.5 / thievery 0 / strength 0.9/1.35

-added four_feet_monkeys sword legs mods

-sword legs - weight 5 / hp 80/80 / swimming 0.5 / unarmed 10/20 / athletics 0.4/0.9 / stealth 0.1/0.5

-fixed an inconsistency in skeleton legs as reported by @Ilumil stealth will now be the same on both legs.

-added lordhapless butcher limbs mod

-butcher legs/ Renamed - Sword Legs MK2 - weight 10 / Hp 80/100 / swimming 0.5 / unarmed bonus 10/25 / athletics .5/1 / stealth .5

-Butcher Arms - weight 5 / unarmed 5/10 / dex 0.5/1.15 / ranged 0 / strength .5/.75 / thievery 0

-added dread limbs

-deleted the human limbset in dread limbs

-dread legs - (renamed) > Stealth Scout Leg - HP 100/200 / unarmed 1/1 /athletics 0.5/1.3 / stealth 0.5/1.1 These legs won't be the best for speed or stealth but will provide a "mid-cost" alternative for those that can't outright afford stealth/scout legs. However players will need to search for the best version.

-Balanced the dread arms

-balanced nest spawns in the bonefields so that savannah hounds can spawn easier

-balanced the great desert spawns so that cage beasts spawn much less and other aggressive animals spawn more

-rebalanced dreg to greater allow the maned wolf to spawn more.

-renamed the slough hyena den (secret). I think players will like it a little more and be able to spin some new stories from the new name without it completely breaking the lore.

-adjusted the direwolfs colors and textures to be replaced by the golden/silver wolfs

-players cannot tame animals with alphas in their squads (as opposed to waiting for dialogue, you'll just have to find the right packs)

-all dogs should now be able to wear armored bag and the canine bag

--7.0.7 Bug fix update--

-Attached the new(old) cage beasts bags to the correct vendors and animals i forgot to last patch.

-adjusted weight of the pack and adjusted skill, and encumbrance stats

-added a house back to BDC.

-removed an unattached outpost in outlands/stobs gamble as reported by @Dr_Thrax

-removed direwolves having special food limitations in response to @IX bug report. Unsure if this was causing an issue with them eating from the animal feeder but according to another modders report could be worthwhile to check out.

-adjusted the animals aggressive cut damage. (turns out i was overzealous in the balance, the animal weapons are actually stronger than meitou, ooops) 1.2 > 1.05. This should make all animals a serious threat without them hitting 300 damage.

-adjusted the animals passive blunt damage, once again overzealous edit. 1.2 > 1.05 / Also upped the cut a little as it's slightly to weak. 0.5 > 0.8

-changed name of direwolves. Great Direwolf > Direwolf

-added various hair color variations and tone maps to direwolves. So despite using the same textures as other dogs you should see a lot more colors and hair patterns across the direwolves.

-changed the armored canine pack from 2x2 to a 4x4 size bag. this should allow enough wiggle room for dogs to use the bad and eat from the animal feeder (if that's what the bug is)

-made direwolves cost a ridiculous amount, just on the off chance that i missed a police dog somewhere. Though with this change i will probably add farm shops back in certain areas.

-direwolves are now only found in okrans arm/hidden forest area, excluding police dogs variants.

-direwolves are now tameable (was forgotten last patch)

-added a bag back to the wandering guild traders

-adjusted facility 0-42 to hopefully fix pathfinding and enemy spawns as reported by @KillZone

-adjusted the positioning and building type of the tower of abuse. this should help path finding and make it the building more accessible overall.

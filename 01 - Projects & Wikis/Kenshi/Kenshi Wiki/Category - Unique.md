### [Characters](:Category:Characters "wikilink") and [Animals](:Category:Animals "wikilink")

These characters only die once. If looted and left alive after a fight,
they can regain their health and items when the player reloads their
location. Many of these characters are tied to aÂ [](World_States.md).

Unique animals will not survive looting since animals die when you rip
them apart. If left alive and healed, unique animals can be returned to
and fought again.

### [Unique Items](Unique_Items.md "wikilink")

These items only spawn in a couple specific places. They may be death
items which are only found on unique animals or lore items which are
easy to miss.

To decrease clutter, [Lore Books](Lore_Books.md "wikilink") will not be
included in this list. __NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

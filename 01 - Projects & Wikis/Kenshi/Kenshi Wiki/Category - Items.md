**Items** are objects in Kenshi which can be held in a character's
inventory. [Equipment](Equipment.md "wikilink") such as
[Armour](:Category:Armour "wikilink") and [Weapons](Weapons.md "wikilink")
are also items, however those are not listed in this category since they
have more specific game functions. Many items are used in
[Construction](Construction.md "wikilink") or
[Crafting](Crafting.md "wikilink"), although some are simply [](Trade_Goods.md).

### [Books](:Category:Books "wikilink")

The Books category is for [Lore Books](Lore_Books.md "wikilink"). These
items aren't worth much currency, but they are one of the primary ways
of learning about the world and history of Kenshi.

### [Nutrition](:Category:Nutrition "wikilink")

Nutrition is a property which many Items have. This property allows
those items to be consumed by characters in order to fill the
character's hunger meter. These items are typically considered
[Food](Food.md "wikilink") items.

### [Unique](:Category:Unique "wikilink")

These items only spawn in a couple specific places. They may be death
items which are only found on unique animals or lore items which are
easy to miss.

To decrease clutter, [Lore Books](Lore_Books.md "wikilink") will not be
included in this list.

### [Retired Items](:Category:Retired_Items "wikilink")

This category is for items which were either renamed and the pages were
not, or for items which used to be a part of Kenshi but are not
anymore.__NOEDITSECTION__ __NOTOC__

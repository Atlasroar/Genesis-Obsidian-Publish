**Generator Core** is an [item](Items.md "wikilink") which has no
designated function. It is one of the heaviest objects, making it useful
for [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") training. Aside from that, its only
use is trading.

In lore-wise terms, it's most likely used as an essential component for
setting up [Wind](Wind_Generator.md "wikilink") and [](Small_Generator.md), as well as a component to
repair those generators in case they break down.

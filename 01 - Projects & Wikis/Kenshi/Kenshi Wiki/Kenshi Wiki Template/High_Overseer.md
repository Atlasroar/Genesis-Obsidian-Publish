**High Overseers** are the leading authority figures of a [](Holy_Mines.md). Killing a High Overseer will NOT destroy
the Holy Mine, however.

They are charged with overseeing day-to-day operations and making sure
the [Lower Servants](Lower_Servant.md "wikilink") are kept in line. They
command a Holy Mine's garrison of [Slavers](Slaver.md "wikilink"),
[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink") and [](Holy_Sentinel.md).

High Overseers are similar in appearance to [](High_Paladin.md), but they do not carry a [](Paladin's_Cross.md) or wear a helmet. Despite wearing
[High Paladin](High_Paladin.md "wikilink") colors, they are no stronger
than a regular Paladin.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction.

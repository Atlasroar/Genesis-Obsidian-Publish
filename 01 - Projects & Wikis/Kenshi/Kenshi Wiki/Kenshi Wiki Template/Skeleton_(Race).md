![](Skeleton.png "Skeleton.png") **Skeleton** is a
[Race](Races.md "wikilink") in Kenshi. It is a subrace of
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") and the primary race for
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") [](Playable_Characters.md).

Skeletons do not need to eat, making these characters great for Outpost
defense. Skeletons also do not need to use the
[Swimming](Swimming.md "wikilink") statistic as they will always move at 30
units (6.711mph) under water.

Basic skeletons have a healrate of 2, while the skeleton sub-races have
a healrate of 3. As healrate is tied to maximum health this means that
(Assuming no wear damage) a Skeleton will heal stun damage 4x faster
than a Greenlander. Additionally, they have a slightly lower chance of
being hit in the Stomach relative to their other body parts.

## Trivia

- The Holy Nation has a racial distrust for the Skeletons due to their
  religious beliefs and will attack Skeletons on sight.
- Interestingly The Holy Nation has a neutral faction relation with the
  Skeletons faction. Of course they will still attack them on sight due
  to their race.
- The "Skeleton (Race)" is somewhat a misnomer as it refers to a
  <u>subrace</u> of [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink"), a sentient race
  that contains many other different mechanic subraces, including the
  one that is the subject of this article. While it is the "default"
  skeleton race from the player's point of view, it deserves a name of
  its own within lore to avoid confusion with the others.
- Interestingly, this particular subrace of Skeleton's head-type is the
  only one not found on any of the MkII/MKII variant of Skeletons.

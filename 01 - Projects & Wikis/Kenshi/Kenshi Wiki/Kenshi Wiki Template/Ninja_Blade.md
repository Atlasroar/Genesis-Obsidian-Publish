The **Ninja Blade** is a sleek and lightweight weapon. This weapon is
often used by ninjas and assassins. It has the lowest cut damage of any
[Katana](Katanas.md "wikilink"), even an Edge Type 3

Ninja Blade.

Ninja Blade... For whatever reason, you will find the
[Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") version of this weapon in the hands of

## Trivia

- Based on [Ninjato](wikipedia:Ninjato "wikilink") (忍者刀/Ninjatō)
  which is a never confirmed katana like sword legendarily used by ninja
  of feudal Japan portrayed in movies and television.
- Formerly named as **Katana-Straight** in earlier game version. In
  real-life, ninjato seems to be a different blade type from katana.
- The ninjato is reputed to be a multi-function tool, including the
  scabbard which is made longer than the blade to hide things, or to
  reputedly mislead opponents which will be surprised by the faster
  drawing of the short blade. It scabbard is said to be even be used as
  a "breathing straw" when underwater.

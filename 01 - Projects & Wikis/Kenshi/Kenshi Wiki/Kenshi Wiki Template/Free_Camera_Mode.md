Free camera mode was introduced 1st April 2024 in the version 1.0.67.

![](FreeCameraMode.png "FreeCameraMode.png")The following quote is from
the community announcement about the release.

*"We know that sometimes it can be a pain trying to get a perfect angle
when recording videos or taking a screenshot in Kenshi. Clipping can
drive you mad, character close-ups are near impossible and the camera
sticking to the ground can be a right faff. And what if you just want to
move the camera vertically?*

*Well we’ve a small update to address the above problems that also adds
a handy lil rule of thirds overlay grid for getting those perfect
shots.*

*We’d like to set some expectations here: this isn’t an all-singing AAA
photo mode with a ton of filters, facial expression controls or
time-of-day changes. As we’ve said many times before - we’re spending
our time pretty much exclusively on Kenshi 2 right now. But these little
additions and fixes helped our internal team creating Kenshi content, so
we thought we’d pass them on to the community.*

*If you’re wanting to go a little further with your shots and add some
depth-of-field et al, you could always (at your own risk) give the
impressive post-processing injector ReShade a go. Just be aware that any
performance issues experienced using ReShade fall outside our remit.*

*If you experience any issues after the update, please read this post on
how to report crashes or bugs and make a post in the Lo-Fi Games forum,
ensuring that you’re nice to our lovely moderators."*

**Samurai Gate Guards** are well-equipped static sentries for the
[United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") that protect the entrances to
their towns, including small villages. Their
[sergeants](Samurai_Gate_Sergeant.md "wikilink") sometimes stop travellers
to check for contraband.

It is likely that they are veteran [Samurais](Samurai.md "wikilink") that
earned the rank to be a gate guard given their title and similar but
slightly stronger stats.

Gate guards will usually accompany a sergeant in groups of 6 to 8 in
major towns, or up to 2 in the case of villages. There will always be 8
of them guarding [Tengu's Vault](Tengu's_Vault.md "wikilink"). Malnourished
towns will only have 2 to 4 guards.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

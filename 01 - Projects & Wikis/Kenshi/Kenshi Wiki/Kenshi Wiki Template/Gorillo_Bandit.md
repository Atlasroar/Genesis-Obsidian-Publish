**Gorillo Bandits** are members of [](The_Gorrillo_Bandits.md). Unlike their leader,
[Gorrillo](Gorrillo.md "wikilink"), they carry no weapons and wear no
armor. They can be seen in packs harassing settlements and wanderers
within [Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink") and [](Flats_Lagoon.md). A defining feature of a Gorillo Bandit
is their unnaturally bulky arms and hunchbacked appearance and also the
[The Gorrillo Bandits](The_Gorrillo_Bandits.md "wikilink") scorchlanders
have Greenlander skin like [Stubs Momuso](Stubs_Momuso.md "wikilink")

There is a 3% chance that a Gorillo Bandit will have a bounty of 5000 c
from the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") and the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

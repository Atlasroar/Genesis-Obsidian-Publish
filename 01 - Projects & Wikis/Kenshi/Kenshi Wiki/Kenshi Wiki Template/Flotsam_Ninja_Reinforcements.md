**Flotsam Ninja Reinforcements** is a bugged [Event](Events.md "wikilink")
that is supposed to trigger in response to the [](Holy_Assault.md), [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Major).md), [](Retribution_of_God.md), and [](Wrath_of_God.md) events, as long as the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") is allied to the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) and not the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md), while [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") and
[Yayoi](Yayoi.md "wikilink") are both alive and free.

Once triggered, the [Flotsam Ninjas](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") will
send reinforcements from the [](Flotsam_Village.md) or a [](Scout_Post.md). While they will move faster than most
hostile events, they can still arrive too late if the player's
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") is closer to the hostile
event's spawn location than to the origin of the reinforcements. These
reinforcements will consist of 1-3 squads, made up of 4-10 [](Flotsam_Ninja.md), and led by [Yayoi](Yayoi.md "wikilink").

Once the reinforcements arrive, they will give a short speech, and then
start patrolling the player's base, attacking hostiles, defending the
player's characters, and healing wounded allies.

As implied earlier, this event however is bugged, and will not trigger
in vanilla due to [Yayoi](Yayoi.md "wikilink") missing a squad template.
There are however mods to fix the issue, such as the mod [Yayoi
Appears](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2841885683).

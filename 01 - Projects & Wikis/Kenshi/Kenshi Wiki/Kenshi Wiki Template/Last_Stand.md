**Last Stand** is a [Shek](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") Fortress split up
into 2 walled areas. The first area has two [](Faction_HQ.md) buildings, a [Bar](Shek_Bar.md "wikilink"), a
[Police Station](Police_Station.md "wikilink") and a couple of ruined
buildings. Its location can be revealed by reading the
**[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the Shek Kingdom**.

The other walled area has 4 [](Police_Station.md), a [](Shek_Weapon_Shop.md), a [](Armour_&_Clothing_Shops.md), a [](Faction_HQ.md) and a couple of ruined buildings.

It is a place where older [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") go to prepare
themselves for an honorable death against the
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") (in the neighboring region
[Arach](Arach.md "wikilink")), this offers some unique dialog options with
shek NPC's inside the bar.

There is also a chance for a player to encounter some [](Unique_Recruits.md) inside the bar here such as
[Oron](Oron.md "wikilink"), [Ruka](Ruka.md "wikilink"), [](Rane_the_Giant.md) and [Kang](Kang.md "wikilink").

Last Stand and [Narko's Trap](Narko's_Trap.md "wikilink") are the only two
settlements with multiple walled areas.

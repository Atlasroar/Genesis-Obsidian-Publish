**Shark** is a city run by outlaws, ex-slaves, gangs, assassins,
criminals and anyone else just trying to make a living. It is located in
the center of [the Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink") and serves as the center
of trade within the marshy land.

The city is under the guise of being run by the
[Swampers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Swampers.md "wikilink"), but you quickly learn the
[Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") set up base here and actually call the
shots. In the town you can gamble in a
"[bar](Blackshifter_Casino_Bar.md "wikilink")" run by one of the gangs, the
[Blackshifters](Blackshifters.md "wikilink"), or trade and gather
information in [the Dancing Skeleton](The_Dancing_Skeleton.md "wikilink").
There are various merchants that deal anything from weapons to hashish
and many residential buildings for sale to call home.

Don't get too comfortable though. There's always something going down
from [Blood Spider](Blood_Spider.md "wikilink") attacks, to drunk [](Bar_Thugs.md), and [Red Sabre](Red_Sabres.md "wikilink") and
[Swamp Ninja](Swamp_Ninjas.md "wikilink") assaults.

[The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") pacifier can be found
here. [Doctor Chung](Doctor_Chung.md "wikilink"),
[Green](Green.md "wikilink"), [Stubs Momuso](Stubs_Momuso.md "wikilink") could
also be recruited here unless they are in [](Mud_Town.md). [Hamut](Hamut.md "wikilink") has a chance to
spawn in Shark as well. Uniquely named [](Skeleton_Survivor.md) will always be found in Shark.
[Disheartened Skeleton](Disheartened_Skeleton.md "wikilink") may be found
there as well.

- A city run by a number of street gangs, similar to Shark, is found in
  Fallout 2 (New Reno) and Fallout New Vegas (Vegas) and might have been
  inspired by them.

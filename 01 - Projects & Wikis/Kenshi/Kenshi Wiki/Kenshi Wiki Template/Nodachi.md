A **Nodachi** is a [Katana Class](Katanas.md "wikilink") weapon. Heavier,
with increased range and damage compared to most katanas at the expense
of indoor penalties. It is very widely used, including by many of the
more elite samurai of the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"). It
has the second lowest -Armour Penetration of the Katanas (Ninja blade
has -20% as well but it is Ninja blade so...) making it decent (Katana
wise) for taking on armoured foes. Due to the reduced Defense and indoor
penalty a Rusted Junk version can be used to level Defense up extremely
fast inside of a building.

The [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") version of this weapon can be found on
the leader of Skin Bandits, [Savant](Savant.md "wikilink").

This weapon has inventory dimensions of **1x10**, meaning it can only be
equipped as a primary weapon.

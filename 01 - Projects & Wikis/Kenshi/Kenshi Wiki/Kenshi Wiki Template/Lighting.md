In the world of Kenshi, much like the real world, **lighting** plays
more than an aesthetic role and is a small but important factor to take
into account when doing anything from collecting resources to waging
war. Characters suffer a penalty when performing jobs without sufficient
lighting, this applies to working a mine, a craft bench, or fighting,
among other activities. It may seem like a small consideration, but if
you are trying to craft high quality equipment you may find your
character struggles during the night, or take a penalty to their stats
once the light fades away.

To combat this there are several ways to provide a light source during
the night, these range from lower tier solutions such as the torch post,
to higher tier constructions like interior lighting and light posts,
which run off of [electricity](Power.md "wikilink").

All the lighting options that are currently in-game can be found in the
research bench, and then in the lighting section of the build menu. It
is important to note that, it is unclear right now if camp fires and
torches remove the penalty (partially or completely) and if they don't,
whether this is an intended feature or not. However, the higher tier
lighting options do impact effectiveness which should be displayed on
your characters statistics in-game.

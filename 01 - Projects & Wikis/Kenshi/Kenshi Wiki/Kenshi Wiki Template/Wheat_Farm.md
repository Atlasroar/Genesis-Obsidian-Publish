A wheat farm producesÂ [Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink"), it can be
farmed in Arid [Environments](Environment.md "wikilink") at 60% efficiency
and green biomes at 100% efficiency. It takes ten wheatstraw to make one
strawflour, if you're going to survive on bread then you will need to
make it a priority to get a lot of wheat farms up and running.

Research Requirements

- [Wheatstraw Farming](Wheatstraw_Farming_(Tech).md "wikilink")

Wheat Farm S

- Costs 10 Wheatstraw to build
- Each farm contains 25 plants
- Takes 24 in game hours to fully grow at 100% fertility
- Must be harvested within 48 in game hours

Wheat Farm M

- Costs 25 Wheatstraw to build, 15 to upgrade from Wheat Farm S
- Each farm contains 49 plants
- Takes 24 in game hours to fully grow at 100% fertility
- Must be harvested within 48 in game hours

Wheat Farm L

- Costs 40 Wheatstraw to build, 15 to upgrade from Wheat Farm M
- Each farm contains 72 plants
- Takes 24 in game hours to fully grow at 100% fertility
- Must be harvested within 48 in game hours

Wheat Farm XL

- Costs 60 Wheatstraw to build, 20 to upgrade from Wheat Farm L
- Each farm contains 100 plants
- Takes 24 (25?) in game hours to fully grow
- Takes ~2.4 in game minutes for each plant to harvest, so ~4 hours for
  a full farm, not considering moving of the farmer

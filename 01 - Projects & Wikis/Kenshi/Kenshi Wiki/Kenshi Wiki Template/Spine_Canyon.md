**Spine Canyon** is a long rocky plateau range that separates
[Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink") and [](The_Great_Desert.md). The
[Bloodraiders](Bloodraiders.md "wikilink") and [](Sand_Ninjas.md) call this place home and can be found
roaming this small region. [Skimmers](Skimmer.md "wikilink") are also known
to roam the area.

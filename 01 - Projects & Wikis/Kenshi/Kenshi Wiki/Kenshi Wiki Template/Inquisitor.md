**Inquisitors** are elite law enforcers and commanders of the [](Holy_Nation.md). They run the Holy Nation's
[Inquisitoriums](Police_Station.md "wikilink").

Inquisitors are charged with seeking out heretics of
[Okran](Okran.md "wikilink"), as well as acting as the chief leaders of the
Holy Army. They are also responsible for the day-to-day operation of
town police stations, known as Inquisitoriums. Their duties include
locking up prisoners, handling bails, and re-selling confiscated
equipment.

Inquisitors are powerful warriors, even stronger than [](High_Paladin.md). They have authority over High
Paladins as well, often leading them on patrols. Inquisitors are
therefore among the highest ranks in the Holy Nation, especially High
Inquisitors, who serve as the [right](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md "wikilink")
[hand](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md "wikilink") men of the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md).

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction. The color used is "Holy Nation Level 3".

## Player Interactions

Inquisitors are dismissive of female and non-human characters, so only
human males can turn in bounties by speaking to them. However, a
female/non-human character can still drop a bounty in a cage to
automatically get the money.

When you turn in a bounty, Inquisitors don't assume you expect payment
unless you ask for it. If you turn in a bounty to them without asking
for payment, you will get a decent reputation boost with the Holy
Nation.

Upon request, they will give bounty money, at the cost of a smaller
reputation boost and a disapproving lecture.

Allying with Shek Kingdom or United Cities and then turning in bounties
will only give the bounty reward but no relation boost and a dismayed
lecture. Allying with Flotsam Ninja's or Anti-Slaver's then speaking to
an Inquisitor will prompt an immediate attack.

If the player turns in "high-level" bounties such as
[Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") or [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") as a female or
non-human, the Inquisitor will be suspicious of the player character and
attempt to arrest them as well.

They are seen leading the [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Major).md) and the [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Inquisitor).md)
events against a [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md) as War Leaders.
Inquisitors will also lead the [](Retribution_of_God.md) event in case the [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) is not available. In that case
they will command one or two remaining squads. They will also lead the
[Wrath of God](Wrath_of_God.md "wikilink") event under the same condition.

Inquisitors also lead patrol squads, mainly consisting of Paladins and
High Paladins, roaming around Holy Nation territories.

## Appearance

Samurai Clothpants are gray in color and loose fitting except near the
shins where they bunch and fit tight to the leg. The waist is held up
and/or reinforced by a leather belt that is wrapped around the character
numerous times. There are also two leather strips that wrap around the
character just below the hip bone.

If worn in addition to certain clothings such as the
[Dustcoat](Dustcoat.md "wikilink"), the clothpants will appear to be
tightened in order to fit in the aforementioned clothing.

## Grades

**Okran's Shield** is a heavily fortified settlement meant to guard the
eastern approach to Holy Nation territory. It is bisected by a fortified
choke-point that cuts the town into two parts. It's possible to sneak
past the settlement through a narrow mountain pass to the north, or by
traveling through the dangerous Iron Valleys to the south.

Holy Nation patrols often pass through the Okran's Shield in both
directions. [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) can be found in the
Barracks at this location. Killing or kidnapping him results in a [](Town_Overrides.md) of this location.

In the 'middle' of this military post, a 'bridge' can be seen mounted
with several Crossbows, likely built as a defensive position to prevent
enemy forces (predominantly [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"))
to capture this military hardpoint with ease.

At the right side of this military headquarters, (when looking towards
the Eastern direction) a [Holy Hospital](Holy_Hospital.md "wikilink") can
be seen, presumably built to tend to and heal the wounded and/or sick
soldiers. Several incinerators can be seen on both sides, likely built
for the purpose of incinerating corpses of fallen soldiers from either
side.

## Trivia

- Prospecting reveals that this town is built in 'NONE' zone.
- Strangely, if the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") takes over
  Okran's Shield (being allied to the player) and then [](Emperor_Tengu.md) is killed or imprisoned, the location
  switches to the [Destroyed](Okran's_Shield/Destroyed "wikilink")
  override since it is not tied
  [Esata](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink")'s [](World_States.md).

**The Band of Bones** is a [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") bandit group with
neutral relations to the player. However, while roaming the countryside
they may randomly decide to attack your squad. It is possible to prevent
conflict with them through dialogue if one is given. They are in the
20's to 30's of combat and not terribly well armed. All members of the
faction wield ancient quality Combat Cleavers.

The members of the Band of Bones compose mostly of Shek warriors who
have lost in battle but have refused to give up the sword. Members tend
to be hornless and malnourished.

**Skeleton Drifters**are wanderers or civilians that belong to several
factions: [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink"),
[Drifters](Drifters.md "wikilink"), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md),
[Mongrel](Mongrel_(Faction).md "wikilink"), or [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md). As civilians of the Flotsam or
Mongrel, they can be rarely found patrolling and shopping in the
respective towns. Otherwise they can be found wandering several biomes
such as [Cannibal Plains](Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink"),
[Heng](Heng.md "wikilink"), [Iron Valleys](Iron_Valleys.md "wikilink"), [](The_Eye.md), [](The_Great_Desert.md), and
[Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink").

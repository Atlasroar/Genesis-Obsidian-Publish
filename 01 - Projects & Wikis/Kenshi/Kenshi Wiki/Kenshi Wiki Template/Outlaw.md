Similar to the [Drifters](Drifters.md "wikilink"), the
**Outlaw**[faction](Factions.md "wikilink") is comprised of various
criminals with no allegiance to any other faction. Mostly used as the
faction for various slaves.

Not technically a unified faction but more of a loose category of
bandits, deserters, and looters that share a common belligerence with
the established powers of the land of Kenshi. Many outlaws are runaways
from the mainstream society - usually oppressed by the status quo,
stowaways from main worlds. Most outlaw rebels would hardly call
themselves such, rather seeing themselves as challengers to the inept
rule of The Holy Nation or the United Cities, seeking vengeance for the
wrongs caused by such a misled and flawed society and taking what they
can take through their thievery skills. Characters whom are later
enslaved by UC are usually kept in cages.

Freed slaves that do not join the player become members of this faction.

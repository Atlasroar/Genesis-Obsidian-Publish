**Biofuel Distillery** is a type of [Power](Power.md "wikilink")
[building](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") which converts crops into
[Fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink"). Fuel is used in [](Generator_II.md) and [](Small_Generator.md).

Requires researching [Biofuel](Biofuel_(Tech).md "wikilink") to build and
comes in three forms:

- [](Biofuel_Distillery_(Greenfruit).md)
- [](Biofuel_Distillery_(Wheatstraw).md)
- [Biofuel Distillery (Hemp)](Biofuel_Distillery_(Hemp).md "wikilink") -
  Requires additional [](Hemp_Oil_Biofuel_(Tech).md) research

Hemp Biofuel Distillery is twice as effective as Greenfruit or
Wheatstraw.

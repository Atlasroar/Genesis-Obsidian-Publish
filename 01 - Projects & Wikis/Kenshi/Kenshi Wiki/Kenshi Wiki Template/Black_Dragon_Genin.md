**Black Dragon Genin** are the standard members of the [](Black_Dragon_Ninjas.md) faction. Their title of "Genin"
translates to "low ninja' or "junior ninja".

They can be found in the [Tower of Ninjas](Tower_Of_Ninjas.md "wikilink")
alongside [Buzan](Buzan.md "wikilink") and [Dimak](Dimak.md "wikilink"). If a
player's outpost is within range, Genin will arrive to ransack it.

They also have a very rare chance to spawn in [](Stobe's_Garden.md).

## Trivia

- They will prioritize stealing food above all else before attacking the
  player's characters. This can create annoying situations where the
  player has to loot back all his food individually from the slain
  Genin.
- This can be used to the player's advantage, as keeping the door closed
  to a building containing a [Food Store](Food_Store.md "wikilink") will
  cause them to bunch up and try to break down the door. Characters with
  weapons with wide swinging animations (heavy weapons, for example) can
  then be ordered to attack the bunched up ninja, hitting most, if not
  all of them, with each swing.

## Tips

- Black Dragon Ninjas lack bandages. Simply dealing a small amount
  (Over 20) of cut damage will lead to a rather death via degeneration
  due to their lackluster Toughness level. A single shot from a crossbow
  on a limb/vital will do as well for anyone fearful of being hit.

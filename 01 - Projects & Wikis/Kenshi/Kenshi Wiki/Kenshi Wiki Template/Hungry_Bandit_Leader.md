**Hungry Bandit Leaders** lead squads of [](Hungry_Bandit.md) and are the most skilled members of
the [Starving Bandits](Starving_Bandits.md "wikilink"). Their squads can be
found patrolling in [Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink"),
[Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink"), [Northern Coast](Northern_Coast.md "wikilink"),
[Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink"), [](Okran's_Pride.md), [](Okran's_Valley.md), [Shem](Shem.md "wikilink"), and
[Skinner's Roam](Skinner's_Roam.md "wikilink").

Hungry Bandit Leaders will approach characters that pass their line of
sight, following them and demanding that they share their food or die.
In the case of the player character, it is sometimes possible to
convince the leader that they are in no condition to fight you and give
them a small sum of money in order to avoid combat. If they accost a
squad from a non-player faction, or if the player's characters aren't
feeling particularly generous, a character in the opposing squad will
automatically respond in the negative, at which point the entire bandit
squad will become hostile and rush in to attack.

Like their subordinates, Hungry Bandits spawn with low hunger, giving
them a 10-15% penalty to their stats, though their low initial values
mean it's often not a perceptible difference. Though leaders have more
dangerous weapons than ordinary bandits, they lack even the meager armor
protection of the [Rag Shirt](Rag_Shirt.md "wikilink") they wear and are
only meaningfully stronger at very low levels. They have no chance of
spawning with a [Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink").

Melee attack affects your chance to attack in combat, the chance your
opponent will successfully block/dodge your attack and increases your
attack speed with a weapon by a slight amount.

<div>

1 attack \| opponent attack difference gives 2.5% to odds of being the
attacker in the next turn.

</div>

(40 attack difference = 1+40\*0.025 : 1 = 2:1, which means you have 66%
chance of being an attacker and on average for each opponent attack you
do 2.)

<div>

Your 1 attack over opponent's defense removes 1.5% chance of blocking
from the opponent (base 70%).

</div>

Your 1 attack below opponent's defense adds 1.2% chance of blocking to
the opponent.

1 attack adds 0.00152 to attack speed. (base 0.765)

<div>

Since attack increases "odds" it gets less valuable the bigger the
difference is.

</div>
<div>

1 attack at 0 difference, increases attack chance by 1.234%(of 0.5) and
decreases opponent's by the same amount.

</div>

1 attack at 20 difference, increases by 0.792%(of 0.5).

Max attack chance is above 200 skill difference.

<div>

FCS 2.14.2 attack chance factor tooltip incorrectly states double of the
actual attack chance. Kenshi 1.0.65.

</div>
It can be increased up to 5 by using the Mk1 training dummy, 10 by using
the Mk2 training dummy, and 15 by using the Mk3 training dummy.

<u>Other XP modifiers</u>

The XP gained is also effected by [](Stronger_Opponent_Logic.md). For every level of attack
over your opponents defense (Or their Martial Arts if they are unarmed)
you receive 4% less experience. This has a minimum XP multiplier of -90%
or in other words, 10% XP achieved at 22.5 levels over your opponent.
For every level of attack under your opponents defense (Or Martial Arts
if they are unarmed) you receive 10% more experience. This has a maximum
XP multiplier of +500%, or in other words 600% XP achieved at 50 levels
under your opponent.

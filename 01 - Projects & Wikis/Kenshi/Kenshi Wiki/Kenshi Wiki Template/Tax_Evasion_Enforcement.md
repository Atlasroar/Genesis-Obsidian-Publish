**Tax Evasion Enforcement** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can
occur when you refuse or fail to pay taxes as part of the [](Tax_Collector.md) or [](Tax_Man_Visit.md) events. It cannot trigger if [](Emperor_Tengu.md) is killed or captured.

Once triggered, the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") will
launch an assault party. This party will consist of at least two squads,
usually each consisting of 10-20 [](Samurai_Conscript.md), 2-5
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), and 1-3 [](Samurai_Scout.md), led by a
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"). Rarely one or more of the squads will be
substituted by a squad consisting of 1-4 [](Samurai_Conscript.md), 5-8
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), and 1-3 [](Samurai_Scout.md), led by a [](Samurai_Sergeant.md).

Once the assault party arrives, the leader will read out the charges the
player is being charged with, then orders the attack to begin. If the
player interrupts the War Leader with dialog, they can pay a fine of
6,000 cats instead and the assault will retreat, while the [](Tax_Collector.md) Event will trigger in 120-140
hours. If the player refuses to pay, or ignores the War Leader, the
assault will begin. If the assault is defeated, the [](United_Cities_Assault.md) event will trigger in 72-144
hours. If the player is defeated, the [](Tax_Collector.md) event will be triggered in 12-48
hours, where you will be expected to pay 6,000 cats or face another
attack.

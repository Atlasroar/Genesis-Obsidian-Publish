The **Shinobi Thieves** act as fences and smugglers in the world of
Kenshi. They are usually found in [Bars](Bars.md "wikilink") or residing
inside [Thief watchtowers](Thieves_Guild.md "wikilink") within various
cities. They can also be occassionally found roaming the wilderness.

You can pay 10,000 cats to join their organization by talking to a
[Thief Boss](Thief_Boss.md "wikilink") standing outside of one of their
watchtowers. Joining gives you access to their towers, [](Assassination_Dummy.md), [](Locksmith_Training_Box.md),
[Beds,](Beds.md "wikilink")[Shinobi Traders](Shinobi_Trader.md "wikilink").
[Guild Plastic Surgeons](Guild_Plastic_Surgeon.md "wikilink"), and
[Wandering Assassins](Wandering_Assassin.md "wikilink") will heal you when
nearby. [Thieves](Thief.md "wikilink") and [](Ninja_Guard.md) will also aid you in combat.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

## Exploits

- When you have stolen items that have a low chance to fence, go to
  shinobi trader, sell your items, buy them back and sell them to local
  dealer for higher price because items will not be considered stolen
  anymore.
- Can also buy half off items offered by shinobi trader and sell for
  higher price at local store.

## Trivia

- In Japanese, "Shinobi" means male ninja and "Kunoichi" (in the modern
  era fiction) means female ninja.
- There is a rare bug in Kenshi where, if you've managed to raise
  relations with the Shinobi Thieves to be considered allied without
  having joined them, you will not be able to later join even if the
  dialogue is completed. The way you can tell you are experiencing this
  bug is you will not lose 10,000 CATS upon dialogue completion. The
  mod, **[Thieves Guild
  Fix](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=809707387)**,
  resolves this issue.

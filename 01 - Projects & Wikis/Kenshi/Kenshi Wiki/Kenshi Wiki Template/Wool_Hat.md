The **Wool Hat** is a hat which has almost no benefits. Players might
choose to wear this item if they are concerned about their "looks like a
slave" stat soon after escaping slavery.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **3x3**.

## Appearance

The Wool Hat is a simple beanie made out of what looks like the leftover
material from a [Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink") bag.

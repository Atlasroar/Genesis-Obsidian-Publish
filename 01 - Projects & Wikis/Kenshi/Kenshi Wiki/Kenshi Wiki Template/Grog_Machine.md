A **Grog Machine** converts [Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink") and
[Water](Water.md "wikilink") into [Grog](Grog.md "wikilink"). It can be
constructed after researching [](Grog_Distillation_(Tech).md) at Tech Level 2. It
requires a worker to operate.

It uses 20 [Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink") and 1
[Water](Water.md "wikilink") per unit of [Grog](Grog.md "wikilink"). Using the
Grog Machine trains the [Cooking](Cooking.md "wikilink") stat, and is
affected by the cooking time reduction multiplier that a higher Cooking
level brings.

Be aware, for most settlements assigning your chef to make Grog as an
automatic job will swiftly drain your supplies of Wheatstraw.

![[ConstSet.webp]]The Forgotten Construction Set, better
known as "the FCS," is a tool used to create modifications to Kenshi.
The construction set is located in the Kenshi folder under the name
"forgotten construction set".

On Feb 6th 2024 we got an update to the FCS, the new version has some
new features. As of this change one is no longer able to launch the game
from Steam Library if FCS is open. However one is able to have both open
at the same time, if both are launched directly from the installation
folder (fe. using windows shortcuts). At this time we do not know if
in-world built or edited buildings save correctly if the mod one saves
changes to in game, is open in FCS at the same time. Read about the new
features here: [](FCS_new_abilities_on_version_1.0.65_onwards.md)

The devs have released official documentation on using the FCS, which
you can read [here](Using_the_FCS.md "wikilink").

## Creating a Modification

#### Making a new .mod file

In order to create a Kenshi mod you must first create an empty template.
You can do this by pressing "New" (the button that looks like a blank
paper), this is where you select the name for your mod. Try to make it
something unique and descriptive, like "LightSabers" instead of "MyMod"
if you are planning on sharing the mod with others, this will make it
easier for people to keep all the mods apart from each other.

#### Editing your new mod

To start editing data files for your mod, press the "Load" button, now
make sure both "gamedata.base" and your mod file are selected. Don't
worry about accidentally changing files from gamedata.base, all changes
you make are stored in the .mod file and the .base file is not
overwritten at any point during modding.



















## Translations

Lo-fi Games is currently working with modders in order to deploy
translations for several major languages into the game. They have
published a tutorial for the creation of translations in their website.
As of February 2017, the Spanish and Russian translations have already
received official, however incomplete, translations.

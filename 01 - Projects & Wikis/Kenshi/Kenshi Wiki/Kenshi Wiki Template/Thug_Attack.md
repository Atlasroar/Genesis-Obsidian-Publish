**Thug Attack** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger as a
result of failing or refusing to pay the fees in the [](Traders_Guild_Visit.md) event. It cannot trigger if the
player is allied to the [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink").

When the conditions have been fulfilled, the [](United_Heroes_League.md) will send one of two variants
of assault to the player's
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink").

1.  The first variant will be sent if it is the initial attack after
    refusing to pay the [Traders Guild's](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink")
    fees, or if the previous **Thug Attack** event was victorious. It
    consists of 3-6 squads, each made up of 3-7 [](City_Hero.md), and led by a [](Hero_Boss.md). If victorious, the first variant has an
    80% chance to trigger again in 90-150 hours. If defeated, the second
    variant has a 90% chance to trigger in 50-120 hours.
2.  The second variant will be sent if the previous **Thug Attack**
    event was defeated, and as long as [](Lord_Mirage.md) is alive and free. It consists of
    4-6 squads, the first being made up of 6-8 [](City_Hero.md) led by [](Lord_Mirage.md), and the rest being made up of 3-7
    [City Heroes](City_Hero.md "wikilink") led by a [](Hero_Boss.md). If victorious, the first variant has an
    80% chance to trigger again instantly. If defeated, the second
    variant has a 75% chance to trigger in 50-120 hours.

![](Iron_Stats.JPG "Iron_Stats.JPG") **Iron Spiders** are robotic
animals from the [Old Machines](Old_Machines.md "wikilink") faction. They
are the weaker version of [Security Spiders](Security_Spider.md "wikilink")
and are usually roaming the wilderness instead of guarding
[Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink") and
[Armouries](Lost_Armoury.md "wikilink").

They can be found in regions which are primarily inhabited by
[Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") such as the
[Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink") and the
[Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink"). They can also be found in [](The_Iron_Trail.md) which is named for their presence.
Locations where Iron Spiders roam are usually decorated by many inactive
Iron Spiders (at [Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink"),
[Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink"), [](Forbidden_Isle.md), [](The_Iron_Trail.md) and [Venge](Venge.md "wikilink")) which
make it difficult to determine whether characters are about to approach
a functioning one which is sleeping.

They're equipped with maiming devices and tend to attack living things
indiscriminately. While they won't eat your unconscious body, their
maimers are easily capable of ensuring most lightly armoured characters
downed by them will die of their wounds without help.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which Iron
Spiders have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

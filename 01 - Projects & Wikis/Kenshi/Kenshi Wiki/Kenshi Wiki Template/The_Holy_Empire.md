The Holy Empire were a neutral [faction](Factions_(Alpha).md "wikilink")
(or hostile depending on what character you start with) that owned the
towns of [Shark](Shark_(Alpha).md "wikilink"),
[EyeSocket](Eyesocket_(Alpha).md "wikilink"), [](Black_Scratch_(Alpha).md), [](Skinner's_Roam_(Alpha).md) and [](Fort_Simion_(Alpha).md) in the Oldworld. You could often
find 6-8 men patrols of the Holy Empire roaming the desert. Soldiers of
the Holy Nation used Horse Choppers and Straight Cleavers.Â 

If you start with the Retired Captain or Holy Sword character start they
will be hostile toward you.

They evolved into [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") in the
final game.

### Talk To

Beep:Beep!

`1. Uhh... Hi Beep... -> B)`
`2. What? -> D)`
`3. ...nevermind [ends dialogue]`
`4. Why are you following me? [ends dialogue] -> A)`

A\) BEEP!

B\) ....

...how... how do you know my name?

`1. It was just a guess`
`2. You just said "beep" for no reason, so I thought maybe you were introducing yourself`
`Both responses result in C)`

C\) ...You must be some kind of genius then?

`1. Err... are you taking the piss?`

Beep:Beep

Player:I think you are!

Beep:\[He swallows nervously\] Sir, I would never steal your piss...

`What? -> D)`
`2. Yes, yes I am.`

Beep:Can I join you? I want to become strong, become a swordsman

Player:You don't look very strong. You don't even have a weapon. Do you
have any skills?

Beep:I have nothing. -\> E)

D\) Sorry, I beep when I'm nervous

`That's a bit weird -> E)`

E\) They exiled me from the Hive

`1. Just because you keep saying "beep"?`
`2. I don't blame them`
`Both responses result in F)`

F\) I am defective. Not good for the Hive.

But Beep doesn't give up! Beep is strong!

Since I left the Hive I can feel my mind changing, the way I think, I
feel free, having thoughts I never had before. I want freedom, but
everywhere I go things try to kill me or chase me. Beep tires of
running. Time to stab the things that chase me.

`1. *sigh* Another weak nobody.  How much money do you want? -> G)`
`2. No thanks, come back when you're stronger [ends dialogue]`

G\) Money? I don't know what that means.

`1. Welcome to the team! [Beep joins squad]`
`2. No thanks, come back when you're stronger [ends dialogue]`

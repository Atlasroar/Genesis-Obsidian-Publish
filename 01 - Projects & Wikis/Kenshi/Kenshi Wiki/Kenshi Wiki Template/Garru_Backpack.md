A large [backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") that can only be equipped by
domesticated [garrus](Garru.md "wikilink") and can stack [](Trade_Goods.md) up to 6. This backpack features a hanging
lantern which will make sneaking while wearing one/by one less
effective.

Can be purchased from Adventure Shops at [](World's_End.md), or the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) as well as from Animal Traders/Farm
Traders in towns for c.2,000.

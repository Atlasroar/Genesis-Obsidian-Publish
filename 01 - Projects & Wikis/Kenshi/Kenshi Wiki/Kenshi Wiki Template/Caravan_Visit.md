**Caravan Visit** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the player has an outpost within 11,000 meters of [](Trader's_Edge.md). It cannot trigger if the player is an
enemy of the [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink").

When the conditions have been fulfilled, the event has a 20% chance to
trigger each day if the [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md) is within 6,000 meters of
[Trader's Edge](Trader's_Edge.md "wikilink"), this chance scales down with
distance until it hits 0% chance at 11,000 meters.

Once triggered, the [Trader's Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink") will send
a caravan to the player's base, consisting of 7-11 [](Caravan_Guard.md) and 1-3 [](Pack_Beast.md), led by a [](Caravan_Trader_Boss.md).

When the caravan arrives, the leader will shout out asking the player to
come trade. If the player does so, they will be met with a selection
from the items below. Note however, the caravan lacks any money to buy
items from the player, unless the player has already purchased something
from them. ![](Caravan_Visit_Range.jpg "Caravan_Visit_Range.jpg")

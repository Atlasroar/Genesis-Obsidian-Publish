**Strayed Paladins** are members of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). They only exist if [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), and [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) are all either [](World_States.md).

They appear to be ex-[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink") and
[Sentinels](Holy_Sentinel.md "wikilink") that kept their faith and
allegiance after the breakdown of the Holy Nation. They have the same
stats as a [Paladin](Paladin.md "wikilink").

They have Smart [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

They spawn in squads of 4-10 in these zones:
[Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink"), [Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink"),
[Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink"), [Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink"),
[Okran's Pride](Okran's_Pride.md "wikilink"), [](Okran's_Valley.md), and [](Skinner's_Roam.md).

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction.

## Trivia

- **Strayed Paladins** share the same maximum patrol number of 10 with
  the [Kamikazes](Kamikaze.md "wikilink"), and share the same minimum
  patrol number of 4 with the [](Samurai_Rogue.md). Which represent the decivilized
  military of [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), respectively.

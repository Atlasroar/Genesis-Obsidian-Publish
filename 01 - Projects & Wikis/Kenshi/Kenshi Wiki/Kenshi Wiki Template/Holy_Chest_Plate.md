The **Holy Chest Plate** is a Heavy Armour that is equipped in the Body
Armour slot. This item can be purchased from [](Holy_Armour_Shop.md). Several options of colouring of this
armour exists, depending on which [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) character owns them. A white (blank)
version of this armour can be [dyed](Colour_Scheme.md "wikilink") by the
player.

It is the basic uniform of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), as such it is worn by its soldiers
and leaders: [High Inquisitor Seta](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md "wikilink"),
[High Inquisitor Valtena](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md "wikilink"), [](High_Overseer.md), [](High_Paladin.md), [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), [](Holy_Sentinel.md),
[Inquisitors](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"), [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"),
[Paladin Guardians](Paladin_Guardian.md "wikilink"), [](Protector_of_the_Flame.md), and [](Strayed_Paladin.md). It is also worn by the [](Cannibal_Grand_Wizard.md), likely as loot from a
fallen Paladin.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **4x6**.

## Appearance

![](HolyChestPlateColors.png "HolyChestPlateColors.png") The Holy Chest
Plate is made up of several sheets of metal overlapping each other. The
armour covers the entire stomach and chest but leaves the arms from the
shoulder down entirely exposed. There are metal gauntlets that cover the
character's forearms and hands. Two additional overlapping metal leg
guards hang from the waist and cover the upper thighs of the character,
with an ornamental circle on top of the plates.

The appearance can differ in terms of color, as different Holy Nation
ranks have different colored plates.

## Stats

## Crafting

The game does not (unless modded) provide a blueprint, making crafting a
Holy Chest Plate impossible. The [](Unholy_Chest_Plate.md) with the same stats but a darker
colour can be crafted however.

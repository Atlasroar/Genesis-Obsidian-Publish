**Crabbed Ones** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 7,000 meters of a
[Crab Raiders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink") owned location. It has a 10%
chance to trigger each day if within 2,000 meters, this chance scales
down with distance until it reaches 0% chance at 7,000 meters. It cannot
trigger if the [Crab Queen](Crab_Queen.md "wikilink") is killed or
captured, or if the player is allied to the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md).

Once the conditions are fulfilled, the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md) will send an assault to the player's
base. This assault will consist of one or two squads, each made up of
8-14 [Crab Raiders](Crab_Raider.md "wikilink") and 4-10
[Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink").

the War Leader will give a short speech then order the attack, causing
their squad to start attacking gates and characters, and attempting to
steal food from storage containers (this is often bugged in vanilla).

**Elite Hunters** are the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink")
special forces. They are usually sent out to take down high value
targets - these include anyone with sufficiently poor enough relations
with the Empire or the Trader's Guild.

Unlike other Empire units, they are identified by their unique names
rather than their rank. They will, however, identify themselves as Elite
Hunters before attacking their targets.

In addition to their excellent gear, they have superb combat stats and
can generally wipe the floor with lesser foes.

It is advised not to draw their attention until you are ready for them.

Luckily, they only assault the player in small groups, and wield katanas
with poor armour penetration.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction.

## Interactions

A group of Elite Hunters are called to launch an [](Elite_Hunter_Assault.md) or [](Noble's_Wrath.md) events against a [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md).

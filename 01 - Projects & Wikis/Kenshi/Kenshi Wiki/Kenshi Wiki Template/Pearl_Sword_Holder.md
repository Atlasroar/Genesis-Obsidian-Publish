**Pearl Sword Holder** is a useless [Junk](Junk.md "wikilink") Item: no
purpose other than trading and only worth a small amount. This item can
be found in Residential Buildings. When starting out, stealing this item
along with other junk can help players increase
their [Thievery](Thievery.md "wikilink") stat with little risk (if the
building is empty) and reward.

It is quite possible that this item is made from [](Leviathan_Pearl.md), alongside other pearl-related items
such as [Pearl Urn](Pearl_Urn.md "wikilink"), [](Pearl_Cup.md) and [Pearl Vase](Pearl_Vase.md "wikilink").

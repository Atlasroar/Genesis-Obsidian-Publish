A rusted and stat-wise inferior
[version](Ancient_Samurai_Boots.md "wikilink") of Samurai Boots was set to
appear in game but does not spawn due to being assigned to characters
that can't wear them.

It can be crafted at the [](Heavy_Armour_Smithy.md) after researching the blueprint.

This footwear has inventory dimensions of **2x4**.

## Appearance

The Samurai Boots are overlapping pieces of sheet metal shaped into
shin-high boots. The pieces appear to be riveted together and have a
slight [opening](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achilles%27_heel) along
the backside of the ankle and leg.

## Trivia

- Samurai Boots one of the two items which have 100% Cut Resistance
  Efficiency, the other being [](Heart_Protector.md). In game the Cut Resistance
  Efficiency will appear to be missing, however that just means that it
  is 100%.
  - As a tradeoff (as high Cut Resist Efficiency is INCREDIBLY powerful)
    they have horrible coverage. If you were wearing only a pair of
    Masterwork Samurai Boots and were shot by a Crossbow which (before
    toughness damage resistance is calculated) did less than 85.5
    damage, you would take 0 damage as a result... Assuming the boots
    were successful in blocking the damage.
- Samurai Boots are the only boots which have a Martial Arts reduction.
  For characters without robotics limbs wanting to train Martial Arts,
  pairing them with Samurai Legplates and Crab Armour allows for a total
  of -25 Martial Arts, speeding up leveling by a ton. (Encumber yourself
  to drop Martial Arts by even further)

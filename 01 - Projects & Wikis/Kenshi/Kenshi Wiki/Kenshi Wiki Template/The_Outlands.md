**The Outlands** is a rugged Zone which is home to the minor Faction
[Black Dog](Black_Dog.md "wikilink"). It is the location of a [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) controlled Major Town: [](Black_Scratch.md). Black Scratch is notable for having
[The Great Library](The_Great_Library.md "wikilink") and the
[Anti-Slaver](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") Unique Recruit
[Bo](Bo.md "wikilink").

Players should be mindful of the Encumbrance percentage of their
characters in this area. Being weighed down only makes it harder to run
from the very common [Reavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink") patrols. If
characters are KO'd by the Reavers, there is a high chance that they
will be [enslaved](Slavery.md "wikilink") and their items will be stolen
from them. It would also be helpful to bring a splint kit to outrun
attacks from them should a character have their legs injured.

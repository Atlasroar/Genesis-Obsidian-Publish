![](Hive-Queen.png "Hive-Queen.png") The **Hive Queens** are a
[subrace](Races.md "wikilink") of the [Hives](Hive.md "wikilink"). There are
only two characters which belong to this race: [](The_Queen.md) and the [](Queen_of_the_South.md).

Unlike the other Hiver breeds, Queens have an artificial metal tank,
their dispenser unit, [^1] connected to their torso, and circular metal
plates throughout their spines. The Queens also have six antennae,
instead of the single one most Hivers possess.

Despite the queen appearing as an organic creature, she counts as a
machine. She cannot be healed with bandages.

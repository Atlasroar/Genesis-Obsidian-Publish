**Biofuel** is [Electrics Tech](Electrics_Tech.md "wikilink") which unlocks
the ability to construct two types of [](Biofuel_Distillery.md). Research into the third
type of distillery is available after completion of this research.

In areas where [Power](Power.md "wikilink") cannot be adequately generated
from the wind, [Generators](Generator_II.md "wikilink") are necessary.
Since large quantities of [Fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink") are generally not
available in shops, players should research the generation of biofuel.

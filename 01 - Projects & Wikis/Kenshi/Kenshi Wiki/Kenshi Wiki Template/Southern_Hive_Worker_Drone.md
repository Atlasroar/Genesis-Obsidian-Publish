![](SouthHive-Worker.png "SouthHive-Worker.png") **Southern Hive Worker
Drones** are a [Race](Races.md "wikilink") in Kenshi. They are a subrace of
the Southern [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink").

Like all non-Prince Hivers, they can eat [Raw Meat](Raw_Meat.md "wikilink")
and [Foul Raw Meat](Foul_Raw_Meat.md "wikilink").

They also have a slightly higher bleeding rate of 0.4 compared to their
[Western Cousins](Hive_Worker_Drone.md "wikilink") of 0.3, and do not have
a [Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink") xp boost.

Though not an option as a starting race, they can potentially spawn as
[slaves](Slave.md "wikilink") in the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), and therefore have a chance of being
recruited via either [Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink") their
shackles or buying them from [Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink").
That being said, their spawn rates appear to be extremely low.
[Espher](Espher.md "wikilink") is the only guaranteed spawn of the Southern
Hive Worker Drone recruit.

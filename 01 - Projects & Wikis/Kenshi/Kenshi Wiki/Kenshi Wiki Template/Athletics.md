Athletics isÂ one of Kenshi's in-game [stats](Statistics.md "wikilink"),
that in combination with [encumbrance](Encumbrance.md "wikilink"), affects
your movement speed.

Dependent on your encumbrance, as you walk, jog and run you maintain a
percentage bonus. This bonus determines how quickly you gain experience
towards leveling up this skill. For example, if you have no encumbrance,
you will have a 150% bonus, which means as you run around the map, you
quickly gain athletics skill. On the opposite side of the scale, if you
wear plenty of heavy armour and are encumbered you may maintain only a
fraction of that % bonus, meaning you gain the skill more slowly.
However, in-return for being encumbered you will gain a strength
percentage bonus as you move, for more information see the
[strength](Strength.md "wikilink") page.

## **Speed**

The following table shows the maximum run speed for an unencumbered
character of a certain race at milestone levels. These numbers are in
Kenshi units per second. 1 Kenshi unit is 0.1 meters. To get the meters
per second value, divide the Kenshi unit speed by 10. Then multiply that
by 2.237 to get mph (or 3.6 for km/h). Round to nearest whole number to
get the value shown in-game.

The ranges of these values for humans when compared to our world's
running speeds, start from around 15+ mph - a speed that an average
human can run with extensive training to nearly 27 mph - a current speed
world record for a 100m sprint. Needless to say, people in Kenshi run
very fast compared to Earth's standards.

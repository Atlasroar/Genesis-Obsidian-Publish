**Stobe's Gamble** is the home of the
[Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink"), and their capital,
[Spring](Spring.md "wikilink"). This Zone also includes numerous Ancient
Locations, such as the home of [King Gorillo](King_Gorillo.md "wikilink").
[Landbat](Landbat.md "wikilink") swarms (18-30 adults) roam this zone, as
do the [Karate Drifters](Karate_Drifter.md "wikilink"), skilled martial
artists. This is also one of the few zones where
[Leviathans](Leviathan.md "wikilink") can spawn.

Players in need of [Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink") (an item which can be
difficult to find outside of [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink")) can raid
the [Secret Drug Farm](Secret_Drug_Farm.md "wikilink"). Beware: many
buildings in the Farm are guarded by [](Security_Spider.md).

Like [Stobe's Garden](Stobe's_Garden.md "wikilink"), this zone is named
after [Stobe](Stobe.md "wikilink").

This [Waystation](Waystation.md "wikilink") is a little [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) Outpost located in the [](Grey_Desert.md). This location functions well as a base
of operations when raiding the nearby zone, the
[Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink").

As with all other non-ruined Waystations, this place has a 25% chance to
spawn pacifiers from [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), [](Traders_Guild.md), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

It could be one of the starting locations for the [](Game_Starts.md) game start.

  for a small group.

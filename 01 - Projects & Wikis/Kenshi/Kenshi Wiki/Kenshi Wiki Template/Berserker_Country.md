**Berserker Country** is a harsh zone named for its
[Berserker](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink") inhabitants. The entire area is
themed with rocky terrain with crimson red background (and some white
powder-like substance) in contrast to the greenery in [](The_Shrieking_Forest.md). The coastline seems to be
decorated with lots of inactive [spiders](Iron_Spider.md "wikilink") and
spiders can be seen along the coast all the way passing through [](Purple_Sands.md) and to [](The_Iron_Trail.md) in the further north.

Occasionally, **Berserkers** and **Cannibals** will come into clashes
with one another here.

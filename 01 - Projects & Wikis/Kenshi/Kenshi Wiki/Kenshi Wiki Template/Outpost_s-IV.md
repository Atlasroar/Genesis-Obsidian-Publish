**Outpost s-IV** are large building models that require appropriate
[technologies](Outpost_Type_(Tech).md "wikilink") to be researched in order
to be built. This building type constructs well on awkward or uneven
terrain.

The Outpost s-IV are also superior to other buildings because they have
an outside ramp instead of stairs (characters can often get stuck in the
space under exterior stairs in [Storm Houses](Storm_House.md "wikilink")
and [Stephouses](Stephouse.md "wikilink")). The metal Outpost s-IV towers
are much safer for descending to the street or ascending into the
building.

The second floor's exterior walkway is technically considered to be an
"interior" zone, allowing the placement of interior-type buildings such
as [beds](Bed.md "wikilink") or even [](Small_Research_Bench.md) in that area. Unlike with
furnishing of the [Outpost s-III](Outpost_s-III.md "wikilink"), this allows
for placement of [mounted turrets](Mounted_Crossbow.md "wikilink") on that
walkway, greatly contributing to defensibility of the building.

Outpost s-IV can be purchased in the following cities and towns:

- [Heft](Heft.md "wikilink")
- [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink")

## Trivia

The **Outpost s-IV** types can technically be placed on top of
[Stationhouses](Stationhouse.md "wikilink"). This could have been an
amazing opportunity to create spacious palace-like structures. It is
however impossible to regulate the height of the new construction,
leaving the outpost uselessly hanging above the Stationhouse structure.
Using the FCS might help you to construct one building on top of another
correctly.

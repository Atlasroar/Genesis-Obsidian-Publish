**Flotsam Refugees** are people who have escaped the oppression of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and taken refuge under [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) protection. They can be found around
[Flotsam Village](Flotsam_Village.md "wikilink") tending to farms, as well
as running the [Flotsam Bar](Flotsam_Bar.md "wikilink") and [](Flotsam_Armory.md).

If they have the Fearful [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink"), they
refuse to trade with non-humans, begging them to turn away and leave.

They have a 2% chance to have a bounty of 500 Cats.

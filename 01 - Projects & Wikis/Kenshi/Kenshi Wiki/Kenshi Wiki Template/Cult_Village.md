The **Cult Village** is home to [The Preacher](The_Preacher.md "wikilink")
and its followers. [Farmers](Farmer_(Preacher_Cult).md "wikilink") farm
outside the town walls and if the guards have taken prisoners, will
claim that "blood in the soil brings harvest" and other cultist
nonsense.

Extreme caution must be taken as any squad members that are knocked
unconscious will be locked in a prisoner pole and if all of the poles
are in use the cultists will begin to beat prisoners to death.

This location is one of the [two](Tower_of_Goats.md "wikilink") in the game
for procurement of the most-valuable [](Half-Eaten_Ancient_Science_Book.md) (spoiler warning: its
not valuable at all, but somewhat memorable).

**Holy Mine Ruin** is an [](Ancient_Locations.md) controlled by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). This location has no inhabitants
and spawns low-level loot, mostly useful for

both located on the fringes of [](Skinner's_Roam.md).

[Tiny Settlement](Tiny_Settlement.md "wikilink") and [](Ruined_Holy_Outpost.md) are similar sites, located

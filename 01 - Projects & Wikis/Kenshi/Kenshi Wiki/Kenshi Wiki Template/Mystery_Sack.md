**Mystery Sack** is a [unique item](Unique_Items.md "wikilink") which
[Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink") will give the player when he
sends them on a journey to kill the notorious Grievewrath. The sack
contains Tengu's royal seal so that the character can retrieve the
"Elixer of Godly Powers" from [](Clunknad_Spanner.md), the skeleton wizard.

## Trivia

- It's simply a half-chewed [Greenfruit](Greenfruit.md "wikilink") inside a
  sack, with the added bonus of Tengu's saliva.
- The legend of a similar name "Grievewraith" can be found mentioned in
  the [Legends Series](Legends_Series.md "wikilink").

**Samurai Rogues** are members of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md). They have the same stats as a
[Samurai Sergeant](Samurai_Sergeant.md "wikilink"). They appear to be
ex-samurais turned to banditry after the fall of their cities to the
rebels and peasants.

Alternatively, they may be bandits employed by the government to rob
wanderers for emergency provisions needed by the government after the
loss of food supplies from now-destroyed slave camps.

Only when specific nobles with the [](Noble_Circle.md) perishes will they start to spawn at
specific location:

- The deaths of Emperor Tengu, [Lady Sanda](Lady_Sanda.md "wikilink"),
  [Lord Inaba](Lord_Inaba.md "wikilink"), [](Lord_Nagata.md), and [](Lord_Yoshinaga.md) cause them to start spawning in
  the [Northern Coast](Northern_Coast.md "wikilink"),
  [Sinkuun](Sinkuun.md "wikilink"), [Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink"),
  [Stormgap Coast](Stormgap_Coast.md "wikilink"), [](The_Eye.md), [](The_Great_Desert.md), and [](The_Outlands.md) in groups of 4 to 13.

The following will trigger if Emperor Tengu is still alive:

- The deaths of [Slave Mistress Ren](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md "wikilink"), and
  [Slave Master Haga](Slave_Master_Haga.md "wikilink") cause them to start
  spawning malnourished in [Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink") and The Great
  Desert in groups of 4 to 13.
- The deaths of Slave Mistress Ren, and [](Slave_Master_Ruben.md) cause them to start spawning
  malnourished in [Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"), Skimsands and The Eye
  ranging from of 4 to 13.

They are likely to have a Maniacal, Brave, or Traitorous
[Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

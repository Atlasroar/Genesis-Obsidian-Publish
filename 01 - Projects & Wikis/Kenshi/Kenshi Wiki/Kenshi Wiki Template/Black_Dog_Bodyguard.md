**Black Dog Bodyguards** are members of the [](Black_Dog.md) faction. They spawn with randomized names and
can have either Traitorous, Brave, or Crazy
[Personalities](Personality.md "wikilink").

## Interactions

The **Black Dog Bodyguards** can randomly extort the player when they
get close. They will ask for 2,500 Cats to bodyguard the player for a
day. Refusing usually leads to an attack. Once the contract is over,
they will talk to the player again, where they will ask for 700 extra
Cats. Refusing, of course, leads to an attack.

They will also show up to a player base to ask for protection money of
4,000 Cats. The player can get this down to 3,000 Cats. Refusal causes
them to come back later to ransack the base.

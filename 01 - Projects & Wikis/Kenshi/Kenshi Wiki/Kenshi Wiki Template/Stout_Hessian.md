The**Stout Hessian** is an article of clothing wearable as pants. It is
available through looting or purchase from a [](Clothing_Trader.md). It is very often seen in the game
worn by various NPCs, a popular choice of leg-wear for soldiers and
mercenaries. The Stout Hessian offers no protection, although it
provides an aesthetic alternative to the base versions of
[Cargopants](Cargopants.md "wikilink") and
[Halfpants](Halfpants.md "wikilink").

This armour has inventory dimensions of **4x4**.

Based on the name, it might seem that it would make sense why the
soldiers/guards of various factions wear these. Although some especially
notorious raiding bands hailed from Hessen, a central state of Germany,
the name became generalized as a term for any German Mercenary. Some
think of Hessians only as German mercenaries that were hired by British
forces during the American Revolutionary War. In reality, Hessen is a
county of Germany, nothing more. Hessian cloth, however, is more
commonly called burlap.

[The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") soldiers usually wear a
version of this called [](Stout_Hessian_Uniform.md).

## Appearance

The Stout Hessian is a pair of baggy cream/white colored pants that end
about shin level. Since they do not extend down to the ankle, the
current mesh does not interfere with the boots the character is wearing.
This makes them ideal to wear with boots since you will be able to see
both the pants and boots.

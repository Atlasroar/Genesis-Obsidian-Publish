**Skinner's Roam** is a fairly large rocky desert territory controlled
by the [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") but not actually
patrolled by them until certain [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")
are achieved. They control multiple [Holy Mines](Holy_Mines.md "wikilink")
in the area, some of them abandoned, though still "claimed" by The Holy
Nation. A valley between ridges in the South of the zone corresponds to
the geographic centre of the Kenshi [](World_of_Kenshi.md).

The lack of patrols in this area allows huge groups of hungry bandits to
harass travellers. Wild Bulls deem it safe enough to roam the zone in
large herds.

Skinner's Roam is also known for the huge dust wall that might have
ruined one of the Holy Mines.

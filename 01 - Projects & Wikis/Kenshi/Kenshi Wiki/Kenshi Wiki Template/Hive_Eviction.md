**Hive Eviction** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has defeated the [](Southern_Hive_Visit.md) event. It cannot trigger if the
[Queen of the South](Queen_of_the_South.md "wikilink") has been killed or
captured.

Once the conditions are fulfilled, the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md) will send an assault to the player's
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"). This assault will
consist of 3 squads, each squad made up of 8
[Droneguards](Droneguard.md "wikilink"), 1 [](War_Gorillo.md), and led by a
[Prince](Prince.md "wikilink").

When the assault arrives the War Leader will give a short speech
complaining about the player being in [King's](King.md "wikilink")
territory, then order the attack to begin, attacking gates and
characters, and liberating captives. If the assault is victorious, they
will occupy the base until defeated.

**Hungry Bandits** make up the majority of the [](Starving_Bandits.md) faction, and can be found
wandering in desperate bands led by [](Hungry_Bandit_Leader.md) (one of these characters may
also be the leader) who will commonly accost or attack people for food.
Accordingly, they spawn with low Hunger, generally giving them a 10 to
15% penalty to their already poor stats. Though weak and ill-equipped,
they tend to attack in large groups, making them a threat to players
just starting out.

Hungry Bandits' primary concern is taking your food; they will loot
unconscious characters and take food items, but will generally leave
other possessions alone, and will move on when they are done. Though
your weapons and armor are safe, 'food' includes the raw meat in an
animal's 'inventory' that kills them on removal, so beware of losing
unconscious [pets](Guide_to_Animals.md "wikilink"). Strangely, they will
not take food off the ground or in containers; though dropping your food
and running is not a viable tactic for a player looking to avoid a
beating, it is entirely possible to do so in order to pick it up after
the bandits search your body and find nothing.

Many of them are bald, suggesting some are escaped
[slaves](Slavery.md "wikilink").

Hungry Bandits can also be found in other locations and factions. For
example, a Hungry Bandit can be found squatting in [](The_Hub.md) under the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md) faction. There is also a rare
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") squatter variant that can spawn under
the [Tech Hunters](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink") faction.

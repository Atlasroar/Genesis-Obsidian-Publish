## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) Their "weapon" provides them with 5.2 cut
damage and 13 blunt damage which is unaffected by stats. They have 3
attacking animations, 2 of which have 100 power and one which has only
70. To find the damage for the 70 power attack simply multiply the
results for the variants below by 0.7.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.05844149 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.02925) + Strength (0.08775)

<u>**Variant 2**</u>

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.06739199 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.039) + Strength (0.117)

<u>**Variant 3**</u>

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.07634249 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.04875) + Strength (0.14625)

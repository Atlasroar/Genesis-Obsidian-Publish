**Eagle's Cross** is a [Crossbow](Crossbow_(Class).md "wikilink") with very
long range and high damage. It can be dangerous in the hands of an
unskilled shooter; a single friendly fire incident on an unprotected
core body part could be lethal.

Weight of ammunition is also another consideration. On long adventures a
smaller crossbow may be more suitable, as you can carry far more regular
bolts with 30 bolts per stack than [Long Bolts](Bolts_Longs.md "wikilink")
which are limited to 10 bolts per stack with more weight, requiring
regular resupply. Though as a defensive weapon the Eagle's Cross is
unequaled.

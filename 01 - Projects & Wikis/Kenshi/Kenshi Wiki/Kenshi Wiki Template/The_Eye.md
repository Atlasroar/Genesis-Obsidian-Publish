**The Eye** is a region surrounding a central structure. When the player
gets close enough to the structure, an ally will begin to talk about it.
The central structure appears to be a fallen satellite in the shape of a
ring whose visibility is heavily obstructed by the sandstorm/duststorm
around the structure.

A Skeleton party member may imply that a second, functioning Eye
satellite is responsible for the laser beams that plague the region of
[Venge](Venge.md "wikilink") during daylight, referring to "the other one"
when traversing the said area.

The region itself is a wilderness with neither towns nor outposts,
sparsely populated by [Skimmers](Skimmers.md "wikilink") and
[Bonedogs](Bonedog.md "wikilink"), alongside various groups of bandits.

## Trivia

- Despite the "Eye" chugging out a large amount of dust/sand, it does
  not count as a Duststorm [weather](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") effect.

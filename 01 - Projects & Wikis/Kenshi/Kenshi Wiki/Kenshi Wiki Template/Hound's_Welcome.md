![](Hound's_Welcome_Range.jpg "Hound's_Welcome_Range.jpg") **Hound's
Welcome** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if the
player builds an outpost within 2,500 meters of the town of
[Rot](Rot.md "wikilink"). This campaign cannot trigger if [](Big_Grim.md) is dead or captured, the player is an enemy
of the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink"), or an ally of the
[Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink"), [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"),
[Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"), [](Traders_Guild.md), or [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md).

If the conditions are fulfilled, the event has a 25% chance to trigger
each day if the player's base is within 1,200 meters, this chance scale
down with distance until it hits 0% at 2,500 meters.

Once triggered, this [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") will send a campaign to
the player's base. This campaign will consist of a squad of 6
[Hounds](Hound.md "wikilink").

When the campaign arrives at the base, the leader will give a short
speech about how the player should join the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink")
by talking to [Ears](Ears.md "wikilink") at the town of
[Shark](Shark.md "wikilink"), or the player may face attacks form other
swamp gangs. The campaign will then leave and return home.

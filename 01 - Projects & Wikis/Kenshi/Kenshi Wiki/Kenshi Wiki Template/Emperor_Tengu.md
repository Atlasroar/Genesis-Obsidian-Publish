**Emperor Tengu** is the current leader of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md). He is carrying the strongest
[Katana](Katana.md "wikilink") ([Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") grade) in the
game.

Emperor Tengu resides in [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink")
faction HQ in [Heft](Heft.md "wikilink"), where he often spends time in his
throne room. He is usually flanked by his diplomat,
[Koin](Koin.md "wikilink"). The building is dotted by his ever-vigilant
personal Scorchlander retinue, composed of 5 [](Samurai_Elite.md), 8 [](Samurai_Captain.md), 2 [](Samurai_Heavy.md), and 5 [](Jonin_Elite.md) if **Heft** is *not* malnourished (the
numbers will decrease if it is).

Behind his glasses, Tengu has the distinctive glowing eyes of a
[Scorchlander](Scorchlander.md "wikilink"), but he has dark hair and
unusually light (by Scorchlander standards) skin, making it easy to
confuse him for a [Greenlander](Greenlander.md "wikilink"), although in a
more subtle way than characters like [](Stubs_Momuso.md) that outright use the Greenlander skin
texture.

He has Smart [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

## Interactions

If you talk to Emperor Tengu, he will tell you that he needs you to
defeat an ancient Grievewrath. He says that first you will need to find
[Clunknad Spanner](Clunknad_Spanner.md "wikilink"), the skeleton wizard, so
he can brew you the "Elixer of Godly Powers." He will then give you a
[sack](Mystery_Sack.md "wikilink") which will contain Tengu's seal to give
to Clunknad to prove that Tengu sent you.

Tengu's "seal" is in fact a chewed-up fruit pit, and none of the other
items or characters he mentions exist at all. Upon handing the seal to
the player character, he bursts into a fit of disturbing, uncontrollable
laughter and mocking with his guards, ending with an abrupt declaration
that it is time to return to work.

If the player is allied with United Cities, the player would be able to
speak to Tengu about war and expansion to other nation, though the
player will just be called a servant and be redirected to speak with
Koin, a high-ranking diplomat of UC. You can then intimidate him by
objecting to being called a servant, if you've managed to make a name
for yourself by taking down strong characters like
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"),
[Esata](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink"),
[Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink"), [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink"),
or [Cat-Lon](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink").

## History

After the Red Rebellion, a new leader was chosen: Emperor Tengu, a
starkly more impulsive man with a lack of common sense in comparison to
his [predecessor](Puppet.md "wikilink"). As is tradition, Tengu has an
‘Inner Circle’ of four equally cruel, powerful, high nobles hand picked
by himself. The emperor and his nobles are massively feared,
particularly by the lower working class, and there are a huge number of
rumours that reinforce this image, in particular stories of Tengu’s
mysterious ‘Vault’ where rebels and enemies are sent.

But despite his feared position, Tengu is only an average fighter,
having merely above average stats and wearing almost no armour. The
noble culture is one of imported luxuries, exotic novelties, and
flamboyant fashion. Although most of the high nobles rely on their famed
bodyguards for protection and can only swing a sword well enough to buy
their guards time against a truly skilled assailant, they nonetheless
tend to carry elaborate and expensive swords on them as a symbol of
status.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If **Emperor Tengu** is killed or imprisoned, it will cause several
changes in the United Cities.

Primarily, if Tengu is killed while the nobles of each city is still
alive, the cities of [Stoat](Stoat.md "wikilink") and
[Heng](Heng.md "wikilink") will become half-destroyed and enter into a
state of civil-war with [Rebel Swordsmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md "wikilink").
Several patrols of Samurais will also cease to spawn.

The capital of UC, [Heft](Heft.md "wikilink") will also be completely
turned over to [Empire Peasants](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md "wikilink") control.

[Noble Hunters](Noble_Hunter.md "wikilink") squads would completely cease
spawning at all places and [Rebel Farmers](Rebel_Farmers.md "wikilink")
squads would cease to spawn in Northeast desert area and replaced with
[Rebel Swordsmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md "wikilink") squads.

Death of every UC nobles of their respective town as well as Tengu have
the towns turn completely over to the peasants control in the case of
[Bark](Bark.md "wikilink") and [Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink") (if
[Boss Simion](Boss_Simion.md "wikilink") is alive and free, otherwise to
the [Cannibals](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink")) and to the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) in the case of
[Stoat](Stoat.md "wikilink") or [Yabuta Outlaws](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Yabuta_Outlaws.md "wikilink")
if [Yabuta of the Sands](Yabuta_of_the_Sands.md "wikilink") was freed.

[Heng](Heng.md "wikilink") would become half-destroyed or handed over to
Empire Peasants if [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") is also
killed/imprisoned.

[Port North](Port_North.md "wikilink") will also turn over to the control
of Empire Peasants if [Lord Nagata](Lord_Nagata.md "wikilink") and [](Lady_Kana.md) are killed/imprisoned. [](Port_South.md) can also turn over to Empire Peasants
control if [Slave Master Wada](Slave_Master_Wada.md "wikilink") and
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") are also killed/imprisoned.

[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") and Tengu's death will also cause [](Trader's_Edge.md) to be handed over to the
[Anti-Slavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") and for [](The_Free_City.md) to emerge if
[Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") is alive and free. If Tinfist is
killed/imprisoned as well, Trader's Edge would be handed over to Empire
Peasants control and The Free City would remain ruins.

Other locations like [Drin](Drin.md "wikilink") becomes destroyed if [](Lord_Inaba.md) and [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) are also both dead,
[Okran's Shield](Okran's_Shield.md "wikilink") can also be turned over to
the [Reavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink") from United Cities control if [](Lady_Tsugi.md) is killed/imprisoned- if
[Valamon](Valamon.md "wikilink") is still alive.

If **Tengu** is killed along with [Lady Sanda](Lady_Sanda.md "wikilink"),
[Lord Inaba](Lord_Inaba.md "wikilink"), [](Lord_Nagata.md), and [](Lord_Yoshinaga.md), patrols of 4 to 13 [](Samurai_Rogue.md) start spawning in the regions of
[Northern Coast](Northern_Coast.md "wikilink"),
[Sinkuun](Sinkuun.md "wikilink"), [Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink"),
[Stormgap Coast](Stormgap_Coast.md "wikilink"), [](The_Eye.md), [](The_Great_Desert.md), and [](The_Outlands.md). Additionally if [](Lady_Tsugi.md) is killed, the [](United_Cities_Assault.md) will no longer trigger.

If **Tengu** is killed, the [Raider Camp](Raider_Camp.md "wikilink") will
change ownership from **Rebel Farmers** to **Rebel Swordsmen** and start
spawning two roaming squads of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md) comprised of 1 [](Rebel_Captain.md), 1-5 [](Rebel_Swordsman.md), and 7-16 [](Rebel_Fighter.md).

If the player has an outpost and has killed/kidnapped Tengu, this will
prompt an Eyegore Assault with [Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink") and a large
amount of Samurai in tow. If Eyegore is dead, it will be replaced with a
large squad of [Elite Hunters](Elite_Hunter.md "wikilink").

The **Emperor Tengu**'s death will collapse the entire governance of the
United Cities' territories and the [Drug Bust](Drug_Bust.md "wikilink"),
[Tax Collector](Tax_Collector.md "wikilink"), [](Tax_Evasion_Enforcement.md), [](Tax_Man_Visit.md) events will no longer trigger.

## Trivia

- In Japanese, 「天狗」*(tengu)* are a type of supernatural being in
  Japanese folk religion similar to a goblin. They are known for having
  long noses, living in mountain caves, and having a mix of human,
  monkey, and avian characteristics. Tengu is also a euphemism in
  Japanese for a bragging or conceited person, which could be a
  reference to Emperor Tengu's ego.
- "Tengu" can also be found on some randomly named characters as it
  appears in the [Random Names List](Random_Names_List.md "wikilink").

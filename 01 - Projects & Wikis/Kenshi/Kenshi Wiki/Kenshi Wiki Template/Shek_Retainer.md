**Shek Retainers**are lower-class members of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md). They are generally farmers,
craftsmen, and general workers and are ranked below other Sheks of the
warrior caste such as [Shek Warriors](Shek_Warrior.md "wikilink") and
[Hundred Guardians](Hundred_Guardian.md "wikilink"). Since they are not
warriors, their horns are cut off.

Shek Retainers manage some of the businesses in Shek towns. Retainers
are also servants; hornless [Shek recruits](Shek_Recruit.md "wikilink")
will mention that their master must be paid a fee before they can be
freed, suggesting some kind of indentured servitude.

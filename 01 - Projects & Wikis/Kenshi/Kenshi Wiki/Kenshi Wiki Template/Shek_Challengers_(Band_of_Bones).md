**Shek Challengers** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger
if the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has defeated the
[Raid](Raid.md "wikilink") or **Shek Challengers** events. It cannot
trigger if [Tora the Fearless](Tora_the_Fearless.md "wikilink"), [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md), the
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"), or the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) have been killed or captured.

One the conditions have been fulfilled, the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md) will send an assault to the player's
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"). This assault will
consist of 3-6 squads, each made up of 4-8 [](Band_of_Bones_(Character).md).

When the assault arrives, the War Leader will give a short speech, then
order the attack to begin, attacking gates and characters, and
liberating captives. If the assault is victorious, the assault party
will occupy the base, inhabiting it until forcibly removed, in addition
to the [Raid](Raid.md "wikilink") event triggering in 200-300 hours. If the
assault is defeated, the **Shek Challengers** event will trigger again
in 90-120 hours.

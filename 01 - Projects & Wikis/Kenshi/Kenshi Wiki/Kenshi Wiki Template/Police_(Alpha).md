**Police** were guards and patrol units of United Cities and [](Dead_Cat.md) towns in the [](Old_World.md). They operate out of Police Stations if
they are in a town. Police will normally patrol in small groups of 2-3,
but on occasion a lone Policeman may be encountered.

## Trivia

- They have been replaced by [Samurai Police](Samurai_Police.md "wikilink")

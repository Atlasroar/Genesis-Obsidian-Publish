**Unknown** weapons are weapons which have no identifiable
manufacturers.

## Overview

Unknown weapons have no identifiable manufacturer due to being
oxidized by nature and are particularly low-grade. Their quality is
generally weak and very unsuitable for combat. But on the upside,
they're extremely cheap to buy. They deal less damage than any other
manufacturer. Various bandit groups such as [](Starving_Bandits.md) and [](Dust_Bandits.md) often wield weapons made by this
manufacturer.

Consider using weapons of this grade for training attack, dexterity and
defense as at Rusted junk quality you'll get more experience, on top of
doing less damage when compared to the other manufacturers.

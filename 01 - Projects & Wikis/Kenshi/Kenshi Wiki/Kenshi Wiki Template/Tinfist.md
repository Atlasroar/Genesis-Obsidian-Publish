**Tinfist** is the infamous leader of the
[Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") and resides at their city
[Spring](Spring.md "wikilink") located south west in [](Stobe's_Gamble.md).

He is a [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") who possesses very high combat
skills in general, but focuses on using [](Martial_Arts.md). Speaking to him, he mentions his mentor
was the founder of modern Martial Arts, [](Gatwood_the_Soft.md), who never took a life despite being
undefeated.

He has a Brave [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

The [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink"), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) want Tinfist captured or dead due to
their stance on [Slavery](Slavery.md "wikilink") and as a result, he is
considered a terrorist by pro-[Slavery](Slavery.md "wikilink") characters.
[Bar](Bar.md "wikilink") patrons in towns controlled by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) can be overheard mentioning raids led
by Tinfist. It is unclear whether or not this is propaganda made by
[Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink") or truly the
[Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") terrorism.

**Tinfist's** Wanted Posters claim his reward to be 50,000 Cats, but his
actual bounty is 100,000 Cats.

## Background

Tinfist's background is a mystery, almost all of his past is unknown or
speculation.

It is known that he existed during the [](Second_Empire.md) and likely held a military,
administrative, or political role based upon his (former) friendship
with [Mad Cat-Lon](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink"). However, after the decline
of the Second Empire, it is assumed that Tinfist fought against Cat-Lon
or did not support him, as their friendship likely ended during this
period of turmoil. It is unknown if Tinfist learned martial arts before,
during, or after the Second Empire's fall.

For the next millennia to the events of Kenshi, it is known that he
engaged in warfare and (possibly) raids on the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), this being due to their rampant
participation in mass slavery. It is unknown if Tinfist has always
warred with the United Cities, or if it is a recent development.

Tinfist now leads an organized group of
[Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink"). The organization currently
resides at the mountain city of [Spring](Spring.md "wikilink"), and is
considered an extreme terrorist group by the United Cities.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

Requires **Tinfist** to be imprisoned/dead:

If **Tinfist** is killed or imprisoned while [](Emperor_Tengu.md) and [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") are
both alive and free, it will cause [](Cult_Village.md) and both of the [](Fishing_Village.md) to be taken over by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md). The [](Settled_Nomads.md) town would become empty as well.

The [Distant Hive Village](Distant_Hive_Village.md "wikilink") will become
trashed ruins if [Lady Kana](Lady_Kana.md "wikilink") is alive and free.

if [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") is alive and free, an extra 'slaver
caravan' squad with 1 [](Slaver_Caravan_Boss.md), 0-1 [](Slaver_Heavy_Guard.md), and 7-14 [](Slaver_Caravan_Guard.md) will also start spawning in the
regions of [Grey Desert](Grey_Desert.md "wikilink"),
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"), [](Northern_Coast.md), [Shem](Shem.md "wikilink"),
[Sinkuun](Sinkuun.md "wikilink"), [Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink"),
[Skinner's Roam](Skinner's_Roam.md "wikilink"), [](Stormgap_Coast.md), [](The_Great_Desert.md), and [](The_Outlands.md).

If the player has an outpost, killing or kidnapping Tinfist will cause a
'[Jonin Assault](Jonin_Assault.md "wikilink")' comprised of 20 [](Anti-Slaver_Jonin.md), with special leaders being either
[Jaegar](Jaegar.md "wikilink"), [Bo](Bo.md "wikilink"), or
[Grey](Grey.md "wikilink") (all of them might not appear if the player has
killed/imprisoned them beforehand).

Requires **Tinfist** to be alive and free:

If **Emperor Tengu** and **Longen** are both killed/imprisoned while
**Tinfist** is alive and free. [Trader's Edge](Trader's_Edge.md "wikilink")
will fall under the control of **Anti-Slavers** and
[Heng](Heng.md "wikilink") will have a prosperous town override, if all 3
of them are killed/imprisoned then **Trader's Edge** will fall under the
control of [Empire Peasants](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md "wikilink") and **Heng**
will have an override that is less prosperous. [](Free_Settlement.md) will also turn into [](The_Free_City.md) controlled by Anti-Slavers, if all 3 of
them are killed/imprisoned the town will still remain ruins as [](Free_Settlement.md).

If **Longen** or **Lady Kana** is killed/imprisoned Anti-Slavers will
start patrolling in the region of [](The_Great_Desert.md).

If **Longen** or [Slave Mistress Ren](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md "wikilink") AND
[Slave Master Ruben](Slave_Master_Ruben.md "wikilink") or [](Slave_Master_Grande.md) is killed/imprisoned,
Anti-Slavers will start patrolling in the region of
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink").

If [Slave Master Grande](Slave_Master_Grande.md "wikilink") is
killed/imprisoned Anti-Slavers will start patrolling in the region of
[Stormgap Coast](Stormgap_Coast.md "wikilink").

**<big>Interactions</big>**

If Longen is dead, Tinfist will have the following Dialogue: "Logen is
dead and Heft is in panic. Now is time for war in the Great Desert" "You
are a legend of the people", if you have never spoken with Tinfist
before this, you will become allies with the Anti-slaves and gain a
massive amount of reputation with the faction.

If you are allied with the Rebel Farmers, Tinfist will have the
following dialogue: "Heard you're fighting for the Rebel Farmers now...
The Great Desert belongs to them." "Another strong enemy against the
United Cities will help tip the balance in our favor"

If Eyesocket is destroyed, he will have the following dialogue: "With
Eyesocket destroyed, the Great Desert is looking all clear. Now we have
an easy path for an attack" "Well done, *player*"

If Stone camp is destroyed, he will have the following dialogue: "It...
got a little chaotic with Stone Camp down but it was to be expected..."
"Worlds gotta go dark before it gets lighter"

## Bounty

If Tinfist is turned into the following factions it will grant the
following benefits/penalties:

### United Cities

- -75 relations with Anti-Slavers
- -50 relations with [Rebel Farmers](Rebel_Farmers.md "wikilink")
- +75 relations with United Cities
- c.100,000 bounty reward

### The Holy Nation

*Note: Unlike many other high bounty characters (i.e.
[Moll](Moll.md "wikilink"), [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md), etc.) turning in Tinfist does
NOT grant you a speech with [Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink").
This is likely due to a bug, because the Inquisitor states that you
could talk with Phoenix after turning in Tinfist.*

- -75 relations with Anti-Slavers
- +55 relations with The Holy Nation
- It seems like Inquisitor was supposed to give the bounty reward if
  choosing "want money" option, but either due to bug or intentional,
  the player will not receive the bounty cats.

If Tinfist is imprisoned/killed, the player can speak to
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") of the [](Traders_Guild.md) and receive the following benefits:

- +70 relations with Traders Guild
- +70 relations with Slave Traders
- Receive 2 [Leviathan Pearls](Leviathan_Pearl.md "wikilink")
- Gain recruit [Yamdu](Yamdu.md "wikilink")

## Tips

- If you kill enough Anti-Slavers from his squad and knock Tinfist out
  be sure to pick him up immediately. Do not put him inside one of his
  cages. If you do so and then unlock the cage, or he gets back up after
  knocked unconscious he can spawn multiple Anti-Slavers to assist him.
  (Common with many faction leaders, but his squad is arguably the most
  dangerous)
- Although he does not use a weapon normally, if enslaved (or caged) he
  will loot weapons from nearby and use them. He also has a very high
  skill with weapons (other than Sabre and Katanas) and has a habit of
  using the Harpoons around Spring if he is pulled outside.
- If Tinfist does man one of the Harpoons, TAKE CARE. He will shoot you
  and assuming you are close to him he may attempt to attack you with
  his martial arts right after. As you will be staggered from the
  harpoon this could lead to a lot of damage or even death.

## Trivia

- Judging by the above quote (spoken by a skeleton in Black Desert City)
  Tinfist was very likely a good friend of Cat-Lon before he went mad
  and was possibly involved in the management of the Second Empire.
- Tinfist possesses a unique statline in the Forgotten Construction Set,
  giving him a Martial Arts skill of 110. Due to this he is the hardest
  hitting unit in game. He is also capable of leveling up to the mid
  500s provided he has a steady supply of units to train on.
- Tinfist also is one of two NPCs in the game to actually have a set
  robotics level. Bo is the other character.

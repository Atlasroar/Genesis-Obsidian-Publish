![](Relics_and_Robots.png "Relics_and_Robots.png") **Robots** are forms
of mechanical or synthetic life found in Kenshi. They are often relics
of the [Old Empire](Old_Empire.md "wikilink") and the Second Empire. A
majority of humanoid robots are [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink")
subraces, but not all.

There are specific weapons which have damage modifiers which cause that
weapon to do extra damage towards robots. Robotic Humanoids (Robotic
Animals are unaffected by this) and Robotic limbs on any race take *wear
damage* equal to 4% of damage taken. As an example, if a Skeleton is
struck for 100 damage, once they heal up, their new max health is 196.
Wear damage taken needs to be healed using a [](Skeleton_Repair_Bed.md) in order to reach max 200 health
again.

**Corpse Disposal** is [Defense Tech](Defense_Tech.md "wikilink") which
unlocks the ability to construct a [](Corpse_Furnace.md).

Certain [Fauna](Fauna.md "wikilink"), such as [](River_Raptor.md), consume corpses. If players do not
wish to attract these animals, they should use a corpse furnace to
incinerate dead bodies collected near their outpost.

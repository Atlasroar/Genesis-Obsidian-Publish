**Raw Stone** is the base ingredient used to create [](Building_Materials.md), the building blocks of
construction.

Stone can be gathered through use of a [](Stone_Mine.md) and stored in [Storage:
Stones](Storage:_Stones "wikilink") container. Both of those buildings
become obsolete with the construction of a [](Hybrid_Stone_Mine.md). Small quantities of Raw Stone can
be found in the ruins of various (ancient) locations around Kenshi.

**Big Grim** is the leader of the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") faction.
She can be found in the Hounds Faction HQ in [Shark](Shark.md "wikilink").
In order to join the Hounds, players need to find Ears to "smooth things
over." Player characters can talk to Big Grim before speaking to Ears,
but she will not be friendly.

She has the [Diplomatic Status](Diplomatic_Status.md "wikilink") tag and
will critically decrease relations with the Hounds if you attack her.

When she just appeared in the Swamp as the leader of the Hounds, she
wrote a [letter](Letter_To_Darkbrow.md "wikilink") to
[Darkbrow](Big_Darkbrow.md "wikilink") with an offer an alliance. It is
indicative of her low level of literacy, but also of her diplomatic
qualities.

She has the Brave [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

## Interactions

After talking to [Ears](Ears.md "wikilink"), players can speak to **Big
Grim** about joining the Hounds. Big Grim wants the player to "drop"
(smuggle) some [hash](Hashish.md "wikilink") into the UC ([](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md)) and return the profit to her, this is
the first assignment she gives to the player.

There is dialogue where she asks the player to drop one of the Swamp
gang leaders that they are carrying. She will not attack if the player
is allied with the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") but will express her
disapproval either way. Being allied ends with nearby
[Hounds](Hound.md "wikilink") expressing their embarrassment.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If **Big Grim**is killed or kidnapped, this will cause
[Shark](Shark.md "wikilink") to be taken over by
[Blackshifters](Blackshifters.md "wikilink"), or
[Grayflayers](Grayflayers.md "wikilink") if [](Big_Darkbrow.md) is also killed. [](Hound's_Welcome.md), [](Hound_Check_In.md) and [](Revenge_of_the_Hounds.md) events will cease to trigger.

If both Big Gray and Big Grim are not alive while [](Tora_the_Fearless.md) is, then [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md) take over [](Grayflayer_Village.md) and may make that their new
headquarters.

If Grim, [Darkbrow](Big_Darkbrow.md "wikilink") and [](Big_Gray.md) are all dead, [Rot](Rot.md "wikilink") is taken
over by spiders.

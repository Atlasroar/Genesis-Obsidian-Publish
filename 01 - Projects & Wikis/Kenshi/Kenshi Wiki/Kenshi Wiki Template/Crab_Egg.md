which can be obtained from [Crab Nests](Crab_Nest.md "wikilink") in the
[Greenbeach](Greenbeach.md "wikilink"), [](Howler_Maze.md), and [](The_Unwanted_Zone.md). While not worth as much compared to
other eggs, it is very easy to steal due to the Crabs low speed, and
easier to carry due to its light weight. Presently no crabs can spawn
from these eggs. [ru:Яйцо краба](ru:Яйцо_краба "wikilink")

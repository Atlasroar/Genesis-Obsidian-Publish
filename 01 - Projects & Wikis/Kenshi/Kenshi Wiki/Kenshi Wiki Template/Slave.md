There are 6 separate **Slave** characters in Kenshi. All of them have
randomized names and the same stats. They all belong to the
[Outlaw](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Outlaw.md "wikilink") Faction and are typically enslaved by the
[Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink").

They can also spawn with the [Noble Hunter](Noble_Hunter.md "wikilink"). In
that instance they will be slaves of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md).


There are many different Dialogue Packages which slaves can have which
are assigned to them by their respective character.

The respective character of the slave determines the relative chance for
the slave to spawn as a particular race, and the relative chance for the
slave to spawn as a particular personality. Whether or not a slave joins
the player faction is more determined by their
[Personality](Personality.md "wikilink") rather than by their race, but in
some cases both race and personality affects the chance of
joining.<tabview> Slave/Tough (not Hiver)\|Tough (not Hiver)

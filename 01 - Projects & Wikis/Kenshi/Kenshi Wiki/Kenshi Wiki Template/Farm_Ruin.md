Farm Ruin is a location in the [](Burning_Forest.md). It consists of two destroyed Storm
Houses and three destroyed Small Shacks originally belonging to the
[United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"). Presumably this site was
constructed either before [](Weather_Effects.md#Acid_Rain) started to occur in the
Burning Forest or by people who were not aware of this hazard at all.
But without any direct lore indications, it is unclear what exactly
resulted in it's abandonment.

There is no loot at this location.

## Trivia

- Despite being a ruined settlement, this location can spawn the United
  Cities' [Elite Hunter Assault](Elite_Hunter_Assault.md "wikilink").

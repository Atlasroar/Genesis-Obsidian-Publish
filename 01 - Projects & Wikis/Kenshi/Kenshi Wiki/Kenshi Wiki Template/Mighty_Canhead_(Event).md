**Mighty Canhead** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 4,500 meters of a
[Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") owned location. It has a 20% chance to
trigger each day if within 2,500 meters, this chance scales down with
distance until it hits 0% at 4,500 meters. It cannot trigger if [](Mighty_Canhead.md) is killed or captured.

Once the conditions are fulfilled, the [Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink")
will launch and assault on the player's base. This assault will consist
of at least 4 squads, rarely up to 10 if the squads spawn with few
enough characters. The first squad will consist of 6
[Cannibals](Cannibal.md "wikilink") led by [](Mighty_Canhead.md). All other squads will consist of
6-25 [Cannibals](Cannibal.md "wikilink") each.

Once it arrives, [Mighty Canhead](Mighty_Canhead.md "wikilink") will give a
short speech demanding meat, then order the attack to start, causing his
forces to attack gates and characters, kidnapping downed characters. If
the raiders are defeated, but [](Mighty_Canhead.md) escaped, there is a 100% chance for
another **Mighty Canhead** event to trigger in 24-96 hours. If the
raiders are victorious, and [Mighty Canhead](Mighty_Canhead.md "wikilink")
is still alive and free, there is a 90% chance another **Mighty
Canhead** event will trigger in 24-96 hours. Any characters kidnapped as
part of this raid will be taken to a Cannibal village or camp, and later
eaten, if not rescued in time.

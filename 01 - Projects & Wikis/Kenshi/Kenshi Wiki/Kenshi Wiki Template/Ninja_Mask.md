The **Ninja Mask**is a Medium Armour that is equipped in the Headgear
slot. It can be bought from the Swamp and the [](Shinobi_Thieves.md).

It is the headgear of choice of [Cloud Ninjas](Cloud_Ninja.md "wikilink"),
[Thieves](Thief.md "wikilink"), [Thief Fences](Thief_Fence.md "wikilink"), and
[Thief Bosses](Thief_Boss.md "wikilink"). It can be randomly equipped by
[Anti-Slaver Jonins](Anti-Slaver_Jonin.md "wikilink"), [](City_Hero.md), [Drifters](Drifter.md "wikilink"), [](Hero_Boss.md), [Tech Hunters](Tech_Hunter.md "wikilink"),
[Tech Hunter Gate Guards](Tech_Hunter_Gate_Guard.md "wikilink"), [](Tech_Hunter_Guard.md), and [](Tech_Hunter_Ruins.md).

The Ninja Mask would normally provide a stealth effect, but its Medium
armour class designation removes this bonus. The [](Ninja_Gi.md) and the [Ninja Pants](Ninja_Pants.md "wikilink")
do, however, provide this bonus. As both other Ninja clothes types are
crafted at the Clothing bench, this is likely an oversight.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **3x3**.

## Appearance

The Ninja Mask is a design that will look familiar anyone that has seen
movies involving Ninjas. The mask is made up of two separate black
cloths that are tied on the left side of the character's head. This
particular mask does not cover the full portion of the mouth and leaves
the left side of the jaw exposed, revealing part of the character's
identity.

## Stats

## Crafting

After researching the appropriate blueprint, it can be crafted at the
[Clothing Bench](Clothing_Bench.md "wikilink") and strangely also at the

**Slavers** are typical members of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md). They are frequently found in slave
camps where they act as quartermasters, workmasters, and wardens.

Slavers are also hired by [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")
to keep slaves in line at the [Holy Mines](Holy_Mines.md "wikilink").

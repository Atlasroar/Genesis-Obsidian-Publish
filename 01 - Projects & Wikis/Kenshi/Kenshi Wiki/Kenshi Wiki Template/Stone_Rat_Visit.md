**Stone Rat Visit** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the player builds a base within 3,800 meters of the [](Stone_Rat_Village.md), or if the player cannot pay the
hounds in the [Hound Check In](Hound_Check_In.md "wikilink") event. The
initial campaign cannot trigger if [Big Al](Big_Al.md "wikilink") is dead
or captured, and none of the variants can trigger if the player is an
ally of the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink").
![](Stone_Rat_Visit_Range.jpg "Stone_Rat_Visit_Range.jpg") If the
conditions are fulfilled, the event has a 30% chance to trigger each day
if the player is within 3,500 meters, this chance scales down with
distance until it hits 0% at 3,800 meters.

Once triggered, the [Stone Rats](Stone_Rats.md "wikilink") will send a
campaign to the player's outpost, this campaign will consist of two or
three squads, each consisting of 5-6 [Stone Rats](Stone_Rat.md "wikilink").

Once they arrive, the leader will give a short speech demanding you come
speak with them, unless you are an ally of the
[Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") by the time they arrive, at which point they
turn and leave to avoid pissing off their boss. Once spoken to they will
demand 3,500 cats for their 'protection' against the other gangs and
wildlife in the [Swamps](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"), 8,000 cats will be
demanded if you have an outpost level of 3 (the town icon). Accepting to
pay will trigger another **Stone Rat Visit** event in 90-120 hours.

Refusing to pay, or ignoring the initial dialogue for long enough, will
result in the campaign assaulting your base. If the assault is
victorious, they will run around and steal food from your storage, and
triggering another **Stone Rat Visit** in 90-150 hours. If the assault
is defeated, a [Stone Rat Assault](Stone_Rat_Assault.md "wikilink") event
will be triggered in 48-100 hours.

Like most tax Events, if the campaign is defeated by a third party
faction like bandits or wild animals on the way to the player's outpost,
it will prevent any future tax visits from the faction until the
player's next import. This is due to the long repeat limit timer, and
the fact that it doesn't consider being defeated by a third party as the
player killing them. This can be exploited by purposefully luring
hostiles to the event's forces while they en route to the player's base.

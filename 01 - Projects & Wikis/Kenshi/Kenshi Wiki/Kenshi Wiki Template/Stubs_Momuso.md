**Stubs Momuso** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink"). He
can be found in [Shark](Shark.md "wikilink") or [](Mud_Town.md). He is a rare
[Scorchlander](Scorchlander.md "wikilink") that comes with a Greenlander
skin.

He is not very good with words so he often mispronounces things, and is
highly aggressive. If the player is rude to him, he may attack, but if
the player accuses him of "eyeballing back", he will branch off into a
humorous dialogue. He can be recruited for a price no lower than 5,000
Cats. Offering him any less will insult him and make him end the
dialogue.

He has increased combat stats, with even higher
[Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink") and [Athletics](Athletics.md "wikilink"),
but no other skills.

He has a Maniacal [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

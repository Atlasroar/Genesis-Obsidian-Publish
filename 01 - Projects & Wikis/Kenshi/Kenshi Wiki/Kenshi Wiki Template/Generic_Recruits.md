The *vast*majority of the player's Recruits will fall into these
categories. They all have [random names](Random_Names_List.md "wikilink"),
along with semi-random backstories. Each kind can also (*often*) be
found in multiple varieties, dependent on the area and/or faction who
controls the bar the player is recruiting at. The different variations
generally only affect dialog and [Race](Races.md "wikilink"), although in
some cases it can affect [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink") too.

Most recruits are aligned with the faction "*Drifters*", so the factions
listed here are typically just locations where these recruits can be
found and nothing more.

Bar squads such as the recruits shown on this page will NOT respawn or
change over time. If you have emptied a bar, or they got killed, do not
expect it to refill at some point. An [Import](Main_Menu.md "wikilink")
must be performed for any of them to refill.

## Fighters

These recruits typically have Weapon Skills as well as [](Melee_Attack.md) and [Defence](Melee_Defence.md "wikilink")
all at roughly the same level.

These are basic new recruits and have no notable
[Stats](Statistics.md "wikilink"), [Equipment](Equipment.md "wikilink"), or

### Free Recruits

These recruits can join the player for free. They are either rare finds
due to spawn rates or have a chance to join the player after being freed
from imprisonment. Some of these recruits retain bandit AI behaviour or

the road or get attacked by guards or major faction patrols until the
game is saved and reloaded.

**Campfires** are
[Camping](Camping.md "wikilink") [buildings](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") which
the player can construct anywhere. They require very few materials to
construct (none actually used in game terms) and do not result in the
creation of a [player town](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink").
Campfires can be used to cook [raw meat](Raw_Meat.md "wikilink") into
[dried meat](Dried_Meat.md "wikilink") from the very beginning of the game.

**Ancient**weapons are older weapons from the [](Old_Empire.md), salvaged and refitted for combat. This
manufacturer is the second-lowest tier in the game. Ancient weapons tend
to be less expensive and lighter than normal, but also slightly worse
when it comes to cutting damage. The vast majority of factions and
characters use these as their weapons, and is generally the standard
weapon quality for most of the militaries across the world.

Their reduced weight make them suitable as training weapons for weaker
characters.

## Trivia

- Given how often military armies demand Ancient-grade weapons and how
  common smitheries are everywhere, it is likely that many of the
  ancient-version weapons are not scavenged/salvaged and refitted from
  ancient locations but simply crafted as an imitation of the prototype.
- Due to how the game decides to round (visually) Ancient quality
  weapons like ninja blade will show at 0kg in game although they weigh
  0.7kg.

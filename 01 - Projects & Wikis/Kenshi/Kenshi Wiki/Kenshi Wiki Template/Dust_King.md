The **Dust King** is the leader of the [](Dust_Bandits.md) faction. He lives in the [](Dust_King_Tower.md).

Aside from having an army of [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandit.md "wikilink")
protecting him, there are also quite a few [](Dust_Boss.md) with standard or better equipment.

He is wanted by [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md). His actual bounty is c.35,000,
although his Wanted Poster claims his bounty is c.30,000.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If the **Dust King** is <u>killed</u>, the '[](Bandit_Demands.md)' outpost [Event](Events.md "wikilink")
by [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandits.md "wikilink") will cease to occur.

## Tips

- The player can take the Dust King's bounty early on by hiring
  [Mercenaries](Mercenary_Captain.md "wikilink") as bodyguards from the
  nearby [Waystation](Waystation_(Border_Zone).md "wikilink"). The
  Mercenaries can defeat the King and his guards
  ([Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink") the gate helps limit the amount
  of time Mercenaries are being shot by the turrets) within the one-day
  contract and the player can collect his bounty for profit and strong
  early-game equipment. It is suggested to do this in the morning to
  give plenty of time before Dust Bandit patrols return and reinforce
  the tower.
- On occasion, the bandit forces inside the tower won't be aggroed by
  your party when fighting the guards outside. It's possible to fight
  just a part of the group, retreat to heal, rinse and repeat. As the
  none of the bandits carry bandages cut weapons are extremely useful.

## Trivia

- The Dust King was able to spawn as a [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") in
  previous versions of the game.
- Dust King has an exceptional World State condition whereby it requires
  him to be killed, and ONLY if he is killed to work. Unlike many other
  characters which could also be achieved if they are imprisoned. This
  implies that his faction is strong and/or loyal enough to function
  normally without its leader.

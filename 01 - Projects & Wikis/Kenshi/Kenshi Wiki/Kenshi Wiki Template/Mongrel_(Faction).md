**Mongrel**is a faction who resides in the town of
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"). They are a group of ninjas who have set
up a base on one of the islands that give the [](Fog_Islands.md) biome its name. The [Mission Graeme:
Status](Mission_Graeme:_Status "wikilink") and [](Maril's_Diary_Series.md) books detail the events that
led to the founding of their town, though nothing is known about their
group prior to them. They have settled in the fog thanks to it providing
a natural obstacle for their enemies, in the form of the fog itself and
the [Fogmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") who live in it.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached (see image).

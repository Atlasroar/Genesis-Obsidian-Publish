**Crab Armour** is a Heavy Armour that is equipped in the Body Armour
slot. It is the body armour with the highest cut and harpoon resistance.

It can be crafted if a blueprint is bought from the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md) and is part of a Crab Armour "set"
together with [Crab Helmet](Crab_Helmet.md "wikilink"), [](Crab_Trousers.md) and [](Crab_Shoes.md).

This armour has inventory dimensions of **4x6.**

## Appearance

The **Crab Armour** looks like large pieces of brown scrap metal
strapped over chainmail that covers the entire upper body. The chest
portion is composed of a single, wide ridged plate. Two ridged plates
connected to each other cover the stomach, with a smaller plate covering
the crotch. A studded, rust-colored shawl covers the neck, shoulders,
and upper chest.

## Trivia

- 90 is the most Cut Resistance an item can have. If this was not the
  case, then Crab Armour would have 90.75% Cut Resistance at Masterwork
  quality.
- Although Crab Armour has insane damage mitigation, it comes at the
  cost of a crippling 50% Dexterity penalty, -10 attack as well as a
  combat speed penalty. It is suggested to use this armour only when
  training Assassination, Toughness, Attack, Defense or Dodge.

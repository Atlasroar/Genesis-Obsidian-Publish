**Personality** is a tag added to characters, most noticeably on player
characters, to dictate what in-game dialogue is triggered. [](Unique_Recruits.md) often have a specially made set of
dialogue options, but most recruits have random dialogue options which
are dictated by their personality tag.

## Effect on Gameplay

Personality tags mainly contribute to character dialogue, typically
differentiating between similar content variations. However, there are
some characters which have behaviors limited to certain personalities.

Dialogue is most noticeably affected by specific tags when entering
[Zones](:Category:Zones "wikilink"). Entering the Fog Islands with
characters marked as "Smart" will result in the characters commenting on
the existence of Fogmen and that they should move quickly through the
area. Entering the Fog Islands without a "Smart" character results in
the character simply saying that they don't like the 'feel of this fog.'

After doing certain actions in game, such as taking down major world
leaders, characters will say new things about the state of the world. If
the player has a squad of many different Unique Recruits, they might
hear a conversation relating back to their recruits' backstories. If
they are playing with generic recruits, the resulting conversation will
feel less special.

Patrolling groups of [Tech Hunters](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink") can become
aggressive towards the player as long as the leader has a specific
personality.

Whether a [Slave](Slave.md "wikilink") becomes a [](Slave_Recruits.md) is primarily determined by their
Personality, although there is also a chance aspect to it. Their chances
to escape from cages/prisoner poles, following you, and deciding to
whether or not joining you after is roughly summarized below.

- Fearful and Dumb characters are very unlikely to be willing to escape
  from prison, but have a moderate chance to follow the player if they
  decide to escape.
- Brave and Traitorous characters will always be willing to escape
  prison but will usually run off on their own instead of following the
  player.
- Maniacal non-[Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") characters are very unlikely to
  be willing to escape prison, and if they do they will usually run off
  on their own.
- Smart and Honorable characters will always attempt to escape prison,
  and have a moderate chance follow the player if freed.
- Brave [Hive Prince](Hive_Prince.md "wikilink") characters have a moderate
  chance to start a dialog where they will join the player immediately,
  with a 1 week cooldown.
- Honorable and Maniacal [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") characters have a
  moderate chance to start a dialog that where they will join the player
  immediately, with a 1 week cooldown. Other personality
  [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") will run away alone if the dialog is
  triggered.

After leading the slaves whom followed you away:

- Traitorous characters will always run away from you after escaping.
- All others whom followed have 41% chance of joining the players squad
  after escaping.
- Note that due to the fact that Traitorous characters will never join
  the players squad. It is impossible to recruit slave characters with
  this personality by breaking them free.

It can also affect some dialogue options when questioned or
interrogated, for example, a [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink")
[Samurai Gate Sergeant](Samurai_Gate_Sergeant.md "wikilink") with an
Honorable personality will never accept bribes from a player.
Conversely, one with a Traitorous personality will instead plant
[drugs](Hashish.md "wikilink") in the player's bag and demand bribes
through blackmail.

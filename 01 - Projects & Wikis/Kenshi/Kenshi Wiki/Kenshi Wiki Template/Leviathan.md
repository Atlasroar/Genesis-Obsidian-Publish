A **Leviathan** is a humongous beast indigenous to the [](Leviathan_Coast.md) in the northwest region. A towering
beast of the wild with incredible integrity, they can crush an entire
squad of men under their iron feet.

Leviathans are non-aggressive neutral beasts, which only attack in
self-defense or to protect their mate and/or their young. Â Attacking a
lone leviathan within the presence of a family unit will elicit no
reaction from the family unit; it is the same vice versa. This is also
true for attacking a lone leviathan within the presence of another
loner.

The exception to this rule is if an encountered member is in a squad of
three or more, in which case the Leviathan will take the intrusion as an
affront and attack anyone who wanders near it.

## Killing Leviathans

Like most animal Leviathans are "Self healing", which means that
provided they are conscious they are immune to wound degeneration and
will self bandage at a speed of 40% of their normal healing speed. That
paired with their insanely high health pool can make them difficult to
incapacitate. Due their size many weapons can only use heavy downcut v2
which has a long recovery time compared to other animations. Leviathans
have insane reach on their attacks and hit for an average of (1x age)
around 130 (Vs 50 Toughness). Which can instantly down any unarmoured
target without decent training. Therefore, ranged combat with
[Crossbows](Crossbows.md "wikilink") or [](Turrets.md) (Such as crossbows or harpoons) to inflict
damage from a safe distance is a good strategy. If you want to get in
close avoid fighting it with multiple melee fighters in one direction as
their attacks have high AoE. Splitting up your troops can cause the
Leviathan to constantly turn around between targets and struggle to
actually attack.

Alternatively, you can lure them onto rough terrain which because of
their size they often get stuck on. But be warned because of their large
health pool they can soak up a shocking number of bolts. So, it is best
to prepare a large quantity of ammunition lest you be left with nothing
to show for your efforts other than a thoroughly enraged leviathan and
an empty backpack.

It is also important to note that they have a small aggro range compared
to most other beasts. Combined with their slow speed, it makes it fairly
easy to run from them if needed. Leviathan's average speed is 8 mph so
as long as your speed is 10 mph or above you can outrun them.

If you are planning on using a sword to fight them, it is advised to use
the [Falling Sun](Falling_Sun.md "wikilink") heavy weapon because it does
+50% more damage against leviathans, as well as having the highest
damage output of any physical weapon.

You also may get harassed by [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") while
battling with Leviathans.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which
Leviathans have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

## Trivia

- Leviathans were first introduced in [](Old_World.md) v0.70.0.
- Leviathans returned in beta version v0.93.0.
- Leviathans, like [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink"), have very slow
  attack animations.
- Unlike most other entities, Leviathans will not dissapear from long
  range.
- The Leviathan's model was created by Linda "Methelina" McGill, who
  also created the Whistler's model.
- Prior to v0.93.13 Leviathans were capable of being picked up by the
  player, which causes various amusing ragdoll bugs that send defeated
  enemies flying, this has since been disabled.
- Leviathans have their own unique stat page similar to units like
  Tinfist. Most units in Kenshi have their Combat stats set and by
  default their Marial Arts will be 10% of that value. However
  Leviathans have 40 Dex and 75 MA leading to their attacks hitting MUCH
  harder than expected.

**River Raptors** are bi-pedal reptilian creatures with round bodies and
large jaws. They are omnivores and will attempt to eat crops growing in
any farms that they come across, as well as any corpses. They have nests
and can be mostly found in the areas of [](Okran's_Pride.md) & [Wend](Wend.md "wikilink").

A stronger version called [Swamp Raptors](Swamp_Raptor.md "wikilink") can
be found in [Burning Forest](Burning_Forest.md "wikilink"), [](Raptor_Island_(Zone).md), [](South_Wetlands.md) and [](The_Swamp.md).

There is also a rare species called the
[Megaraptor](Megaraptor.md "wikilink") which is noticeably larger than a
River Raptor.

[Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") soldiers patrolling [](Okran's_Pride.md) often cull River Raptors in order to
protect the [Holy Farms](Holy_Farm.md "wikilink") along the river. This is
a good way to obtain [Animal Skins](Animal_Skin.md "wikilink").

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
River Raptors can have one of three qualities for their "weapon".
(Moving their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change
to another quality of the weapon) The 18 in the cut calculation is from
the minimum cut damage (13) combined with 5 piercing damage which River
Raptors have.

<u>**Variant 1**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.77961008 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

<u>**Variant 2**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.83928 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

<u>**Variant 3**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.89894992 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt** **=** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

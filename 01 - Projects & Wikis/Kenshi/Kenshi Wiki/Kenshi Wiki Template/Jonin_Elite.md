**Jonin Elites** (上忍, *Jōnin*, *Literally meaning:* High
Ninja, *Meaning (Viz):* Elite Ninja), are powerful ninjas of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md). They serve as [](Emperor_Tengu.md)'s bodyguards alongside the [](Samurai_Elite.md) and can only be found in the Faction
Throne in [Heft](Heft.md "wikilink").

There are in total 5 **Jonin Elites** that guard **Emperor Tengu** under
default **Heft**. If Heft is malnourished, there will only be 3 of them.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction.

## Tips

- If taking on Tengu either try to quickly eliminate him or focus his
  Jonins. They can spawn with Assassins Rags which will make quick work
  out of anyone who is not highly trained.
- As they lack any form of Duststorm protection kiting them outside may
  be beneficial.

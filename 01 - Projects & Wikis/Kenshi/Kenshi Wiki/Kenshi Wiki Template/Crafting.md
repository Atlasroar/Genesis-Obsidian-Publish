After [Building An Outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") or
purchasing a [](Player-Owned_Buildings_in_Town.md), **crafting** can be
started. Technology must be researched in order to build all crafting
stations. Aside from in [Weapon Smithing](Weapon_Smith.md "wikilink"), the
quality of crafted materials or speed of crafting is solely dependent on
the crafter's level in the related skill.

## Crafting through Labouring

The following crafting stations will improve the
[Labouring](Laboring.md "wikilink") skill of the worker.

### Fabric Loom

In order to make [Fabrics](Fabrics.md "wikilink"), characters must use a
[Fabric Loom](Fabric_Looms.md "wikilink"). Fabric Looms turn
[Cotton](Cotton.md "wikilink") into fabric. After further researching,
characters can build Fabric Looms which will use [Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink")
instead. Fabrics are needed for crafting on a [](Clothing_Bench.md), [](Chain_Armour_Crafting_Bench.md), and a [](Heavy_Armour_Smithy.md). They are also used to craft
Medical Supplies and build Tents.

The related technologies for this crafting are [](Fabric_Manufacture_(Tech).md) and [](Hemp-Based_Fabric_(Tech).md). Fabric Looms can be
upgraded to be automatic.

### Manufacturing Vices

Brewing alcoholic beverages in Kenshi can be a consistent way to make
money. This may require smuggling in order to get the most money per
item, as some items are illegal to the Major Factions and have large
markups.

- [Rum Still](Rum_Still.md "wikilink") can be used to convert
  [Cacti](Cactus.md "wikilink") into [Cactus Rum](Cactus_Rum.md "wikilink")
- [Grog Machine](Grog_Machine.md "wikilink") can be used to convert
  [Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink") into [Grog](Grog.md "wikilink")
- [Hemp Processor](Hemp_Processor.md "wikilink") can be used to convert
  [Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink") into [Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink")
- [Sake Still](Sake_Still.md "wikilink") can be used to convert
  [Riceweed](Riceweed.md "wikilink") into [Sake](Sake.md "wikilink")

The related technologies for this crafting are [](Rum_Brewing_(Tech).md), [](Grog_Distillation_(Tech).md), [](Hashish_Production_(Tech).md), and [](Sake_Distillation_(Tech).md).

## Armour Smithing

A great way to make [Cats](Cats.md "wikilink") without having to use up
rarer [Research Artifacts](Research_Artifacts.md "wikilink") is by crafting
[Armour](Armour.md "wikilink"). Armour quality and crafting speed are only
influenced by the [Armour Smith](Armour_Smith.md "wikilink") statistic.
Characters can also gain experience in Armour Smithing while crafting
Leather, Chainmail Sheets, and Armour Plating. Armour crafting is split
into several different categories, and in order to craft everything the
following benches and smithies must be built:

### Clothing Bench

The best way to level up a character's Armour Smithing skill at first is
through a [Clothing Bench](Clothing_Bench.md "wikilink"). Clothing Benches
turn [Fabrics](Fabrics.md "wikilink") into either
[Clothing](Clothing.md "wikilink") or [](Light_Armour.md).

The related technologies for this crafting are [](Clothing_Manufacture_(Tech).md), Hats and Headgear,
and [Simple Clothing Types](Simple_Clothing_Types_(Tech).md "wikilink").

### Leather Tanning Bench

In order to make [Leather](Leather.md "wikilink"), characters must use a
[Leather Tanning Bench](Leather_Tanning_Bench.md "wikilink"). Tanning
Benches turn [Animal Skin](Animal_Skin.md "wikilink") into leather.

The related technology for this crafting is [](Leather_Armour_Crafting_(Tech).md).

### Leather Armour Crafting Bench

Leather can be made into [Clothing](Clothing.md "wikilink"), [](Light_Armour.md), or [](Medium_Armour.md). A [](Leather_Armour_Crafting_Bench.md) is a great choice for
characters who want to turn [Leather](Leather.md "wikilink") into armour.
However, buying leather from stores can be costly and inconvenient as
leather is not commonly in high stock.

The related technology for this crafting is [](Leather_Armour_Crafting_(Tech).md). In order to make
most leather armour, [Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink") are needed as
well.

### Chainmail Armour Crafting

In order to create [Chainmail Sheets](Chainmail_Sheet.md "wikilink"),
characters must build a [](Chainmail_Sheet_Fabrication_Bench.md). These benches turn
[Raw Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink") into chainmail. Creating Chainmail
Sheets alone can be a good source of money since Iron is easily
available in many regions. Selling Chainmail Sheets can be a good way to
level up [Armour Smith](Armour_Smith.md "wikilink") before purchasing
blueprints for chain armour. Chain armour can be created on a [](Chain_Armour_Crafting_Bench.md).

The related technology for this crafting is [](Chain_Armour_Crafting_(Tech).md). In order to make
most chain armour, [Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink") are needed as
well.

### Armour Plating and Heavy Armour

In order to use a [Heavy Armour Smithy](Heavy_Armour_Smithy.md "wikilink"),
characters need [Armour Plating](Armour_Plating.md "wikilink"). Heavy
armour smithing is roughly the same as chain armour smithing, although
there are more armour options. The Heavy Armour Smithy also makes
lighter armour which requires Amour Plating, such as [](Heart_Protector.md).

The related technology for this crafting is [](Plate_Armour_Crafting_(Tech).md). In order to make
most heavy armour, [Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink") are needed as
well.

## Crossbow Smithing

you can make crossbows and bolts at home

### Arrow Making Bench

Crafting Crossbow Bolts will either require [](Iron_Plate.md) or [Steel Bars](Steel_Bars.md "wikilink").
Characters which are planning on using an [](Eagle's_Cross.md) as their main weapon may want to craft
their own Bolts because [Bolts Longs](Bolts_Longs.md "wikilink") can be
difficult to find in towns without Ranger Shops.

After researching [Crossbow Bolts](Crossbow_Bolts_(Tech).md "wikilink"),
characters can build an Arrow Making Bench and being making [](Bolts_Toothpicks.md). All other types of Bolts must
be learned through a [Blueprint](Blueprints.md "wikilink").

### [Crossbow Crafting Bench](Crossbow_Crafting_Bench.md "wikilink")

## Weapon Smithing

Weapon crafting speed is influenced by the [](Weapon_Smith.md) statistic. Unlike Armour Smithing, more
researching is required to make better quality weapons.

### Furnace

While furnaces do not affect the Weapon Smith level of characters, it is
convenient to have one while beginning Weapon Smithing. Characters can
use a [Furnace](Furnace.md "wikilink") to melt down low quality weapons and
regain their [Raw Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink"). This allows players to
continue smithing even if their iron gathering is less efficient.
However, players must add each weapon to the furnace, making it require
more attention than iron gathering, which can be added to a character's
jobs.

Furnaces can be unlocked through researching [](Weapon_Melting_(Tech).md).

### Weapon Smithing

Characters can smith their own weapons with a [](Weapon_Smithing_Bench.md). Weapons must be created from
[Iron Plates](Iron_Plate.md "wikilink"). Weapon Smithing Benches, or Weapon
Smith in game, can be upgraded twice.

The related technologies for this crafting are Basic Weapon Smithing,
Basic Weapon Grades, Advanced Weapon Smithing, and Advanced Weapon
Grades. Some weapons can be unlocked through researching [](Basic_Weapon_Smithing_(Tech).md) and [](Heavy_Weapons_(Tech).md). In order to make the rest of
the weapons, [Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink") are needed.

## Crafting Medical Supplies

All different tiers of the [First Aid Kit](Medical_Supplies.md "wikilink")
are made at a [Medical Workbench](Medical_Workbench.md "wikilink"). After
research, splint kits can also be made there. Characters will earn
[Field Medic](Field_Medic.md "wikilink") experience while using the Medical
Workbench.

The related technologies for crafting First Aid Kits are: [](Basic_First_Aid_Kits_(Tech).md),
[Medicine](Medicine_(Tech).md "wikilink"), and [](Advanced_Medicine_(Tech).md). Characters can also
research [Sleeping Bags](Sleeping_Bags_(Tech).md "wikilink") to craft a
[Sleeping Bag](Sleeping_Bag.md "wikilink"). After researching Basic First
Aid Kits, characters can research [Splints](Splints_(Tech).md "wikilink")
and [Advanced Splints](Advanced_Splints_(Tech).md "wikilink") in order to
make Splint Kits.

## Robotics Crafting

Crafting [Robotics Components](Robotics_Components.md "wikilink"), Skeleton
Repair Kits, and their ingredients train the Science skill instead of
the [Robotics](Robotics_(Skill).md "wikilink") skill. Having the same
character used for researching assigned to these workstations would be
better than training a character from 1 Science.

### Robotics Bench

The [Robotics Bench](Robotics_Bench.md "wikilink") makes use of a
character's [Science](Science.md "wikilink") skill in order to create
robotics materials from [](Electrical_Components.md), [](Iron_Plate.md), and [Steel Bars](Steel_Bars.md "wikilink").
This workbench is where Skeleton Repair Kits can be crafted by the
player.

This workbench can be built after researching
[Robotics](Robotics_(Tech).md "wikilink").

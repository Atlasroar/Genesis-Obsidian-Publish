**Version 0.25** was a relatively small technical update - so much so,
initially it was not announced on the blog.

## Update announcement (0.25.4)

The latest mini-update is now out and should finally stabilise the game
properly. There should be no more crashes or invisible buildings.

The invisible building bug was a nasty one. It only occured on ATI cards
as far as I can tell, but luckily my girlfriends PC could reproduce the
problem. So I spent the most un-fun day in the world running up and down
the stairs between the computers, loading up the game, and seeing the
same damn problem persist. On top of that the PC is slow as a tractor
and shuts itself off at random intervals.  Then I was attacked by
minotaurs and I had to defeat them with my mighty fists and they shot me
in the beard. Then I had to do the washing up. Then I seduced some
pirate wenches.

And now its fixed.

In the meantime I’m still working on building. You (by which I mean “I”)
can now place buildings, build them, and furnish them with stuff. I
still need to balance the resource usage, and building siege AI, and
many other surrounding things, so you still need to wait a little
longer.

## 0.25.0

This is a mini-update to fix a couple of major bugs. I'm still working
on building and its almost ready.

- Overhauled the material system. Things are sexier now, like my beard.
- I think I fixed that nasty crash when you quick-save, at least it wont
  erase your savegame
- Tried something out to possibly fix that reccuring random crash.

## 0.25.4

- Traders backpacks have replaced with a new version, they are smaller
  but stack more items. Old ones will not be sold anymore.
- Bandits don't use katanas anymore.

## 0.25.5

- Made a performance boost
- Fixed the right-click auto trade functions
- Fixed crash on shift-rightClick
- Again, think I fixed the random crash on quicksave.
- Fixed a crash when entering certain areas of the map

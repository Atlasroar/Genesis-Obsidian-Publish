**Raw Iron** is the base ingredient for many of the production chains in
Kenshi. It's mainly used in the production of iron plates, however it
can also be used in its raw state in order to produce [](Armour_Plating.md) at a [](Plate_Beating_Station.md) and at the [](Arrow_Making_Bench.md) for producing [](Spring_Steel.md).

[Iron Plates](Iron_Plate.md "wikilink") are, in turn, used to make more
advanced materials, such as [Steel Bars](Steel_Bars.md "wikilink"), weapons
and armour.

Raw iron can be extracted from the many iron resource nodes scattered
throughout the world. An [Ore Drill](Ore_Drill.md "wikilink") can later be
constructed to further speed up and eventually automate the production
of raw iron.

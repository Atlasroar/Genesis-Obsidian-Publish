An unnamed member of the [Vagrants](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Vagrants.md "wikilink") faction. They
are a variant of [Bar Thugs](Bar_Thug.md "wikilink") which can be found in
bars in [The Hub](The_Hub.md "wikilink"),
[Waystation](Waystation.md "wikilink"), or in [Shark](Shark.md "wikilink").

This thug has unique dialogue lines including an offer to sell organs
and limbs. There is no way to accept this offer: instead, the player can
choose multiple measures to refuse.

They have a 8% chance of having a bounty from 250 to 750 Cats.

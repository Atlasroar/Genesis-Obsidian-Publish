**Leviathan Pearls** are an [item](Items.md "wikilink") found in the
inventory of [Leviathans](Leviathan.md "wikilink"). Looting the pearl from
their body will cause them to die. Leviathans can be found on the
[Leviathan Coast](Leviathan_Coast.md "wikilink"), [](Flats_Lagoon_(Zone).md), [](Stobe's_Gamble.md), [](Sniper_Valley.md) and the
[Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink").

Pearls will drop from both adult leviathans and their pups, with no
difference in price. Leviathan pups are significantly easier to hunt
compared to their parents, assuming you can separate them. Making pearl
farming a lucrative business when done correctly.

Pearls can also be stolen from the Bank in [](Trader's_Edge.md).

As a status symbol for the rich, leviathan pearls are likely carved into
junk items put on display in wealthy houses. The items made of pearl are

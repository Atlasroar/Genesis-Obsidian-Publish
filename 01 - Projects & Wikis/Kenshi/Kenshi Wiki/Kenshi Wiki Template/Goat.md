![](Nomad.JPG "Nomad.JPG") **Goats** are passive
[animals](Fauna.md "wikilink") in Kenshi. Goats are
[Herbivores](Herbivore.md "wikilink") that roam the map, usually in groups
of around 8. They can be knocked unconscious or killed for their [](Raw_Meat.md) and [Animal Skin](Animal_Skin.md "wikilink").
Goats do not have [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink").

Goats can be found in groups following [Nomads](Nomads.md "wikilink"), who
will usually sell the goats to the player. A unique goat named
[Cornelius](Cornelius.md "wikilink") can be purchased from Animal Traders.

20 to 30 hostile Adult Goats can also be found in the [](Tower_of_Goats.md) in [Sinkuun](Sinkuun.md "wikilink").

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Goats can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving their
position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to another
quality of the weapon) The 18 in the cut calculation is from the minimum
cut damage (13) combined with 5 piercing damage which Goats have.

<u>**Variant 1**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + Martial Arts(0.77961008) + Dexterity(0.77961008)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts(0.0039) + Strength(0.0117)

<u>**Variant 2**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + Martial Arts(0.83928) + Dexterity(0.83928)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts(0.0052) + Strength(0.0156)

<u>**Variant 3**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + Martial Arts(0.89894992) + Dexterity(0.89894992)

**Blunt** **=** Martial Arts(0.0065) + Strength(0.0195)

## Trivia

- Goats, as other non-pack domestic animals, have a
  [backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") slot which was not intended by the
  devs and should have been removed. It cannot be interacted with.
- Goats do the same damage as a Bonedog if they have identical stats.

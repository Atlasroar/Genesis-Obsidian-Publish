used with [Crossbows](Crossbow_(Class).md "wikilink"). For long
expeditions, crossbows that use regular bolts are the most efficient.

After researching [Crossbow Bolts](Crossbow_Bolts_(Tech).md "wikilink") and
learning the [Blueprint](Blueprints.md "wikilink"), these bolts can be made
on an [Arrow Making Bench](Arrow_Making_Bench.md "wikilink"). Then can
later be stored in a [Boltbox](Boltbox.md "wikilink").

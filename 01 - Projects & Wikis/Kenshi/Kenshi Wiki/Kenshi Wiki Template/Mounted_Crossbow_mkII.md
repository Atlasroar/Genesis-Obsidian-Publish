**Mounted Crossbow mkII** is a Defence building. Players can construct
this building after researching [](Mounted_Crossbows_(Tech).md). They can be built on the
ground or on top ofÂ [Defensive Walls](Defensive_Walls.md "wikilink").

The range, accuracy, and speed of a turret is modified by the operator's
related skills as well as the height difference between the turret and
its target. The damage is also affected by height difference. Turrets
will be more effective if fired from above, and less effective when
fired from below.

Mounted Crossbow mkII can be upgraded to Mounted Crossbow mkII \[light\]
after researching [](Crossbow_Turret_Spotlight_Fitting_(Tech).md). The stats
for an unlighted Mounted Crossbow mkII are the same as a lighted one,
disregarding the negative effects of working in darkness.

This crossbow uses 0 power, except when upgraded with the light, which
requires 4 power.

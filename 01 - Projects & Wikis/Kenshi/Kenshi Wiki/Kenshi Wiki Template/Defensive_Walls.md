**Walls** are [defensive structures](Defensive_Structures.md "wikilink")
used to keep potential threats at bay. There are four tiers available,
each requiring its own technology to unlock it and additional resources
to build.

For [Construction](Construction.md "wikilink"), select a wall from the
buildings menu and click on the ground. This spot will mark the
beginning of your wall. You can now drag the wall from its initial spot
further. Note that the blue arrows pointing from the wall silhouette
should be facing the outside. By clicking on the ground after that you
would mark spots where a wall would "fix itself" to the ground, similar
to sailing points. You can do so as many times as necessary. Once you
are happy with your wall you can right-click to stop wall placement. If
you want to continue your wall, you can do so at any time by hovering
over an end point of your wall and clicking to place your wall again.

Security of an outpost completely surrounded by walls should be tested
as enemies could glitch through them. To test this, the player should
close the gates and order their characters to move to an area outside
the walls to visualize the pathways their characters could take. No
movement should indicate the walls are complete. Though the player's
outpost may pass this test, enemies could still penetrate inside of a
walled area if the walls are connected to elements of the world such as
big rocks or mountain ranges. This is because constructed walls might
not be completely connected to them. There is no way to safeguard these
pathways except by pressing Shift+F12 to activate the CHEAT menu and by
then constructing walls **inside** those "natural obstacles".

## Makeshift Walls

Makeshift Walls are the first type of walls which players can construct.
Players must research [](Makeshift_Walls_(Tech).md) in order to build. Once
[Defensive Walls](Defensive_Walls_(Tech).md "wikilink") is researched, it
**can** be upgraded to the next tier.

These walls are made up of scrap metal sheets with barb wire strands
across the top. Makeshift Walls are considerably taller than the in-game
walls from prior versions. It's not possible to place anything on this
wall, nor can anyone circulate over it.

Makeshift walls are used in game locations such as [](Fort_Simion.md) and [](Slave_Markets.md).

## Defensive Wall II

This model allows the placement of [Turrets](Turrets.md "wikilink") on it,
as well as free circulation of the defenders across it. It's a direct
improvement over the Makeshift Walls and requires the tier II [](Defensive_Walls_(Tech).md) research in order to be built.
It offers little protection to characters that remain vulnerable to
enemy crossbows. It **cannot** be upgraded to a higher tier wall type
directly.

### **Construction Info**

- Material cost: 2 [Building Materials](Building_Materials.md "wikilink")
- Estimated build time: 2 Hours
- Power consumption: 0
- Bonus to mounted turrets: 0%

## Defensive Wall III

It inherits the ability of placing [Turrets](Turrets.md "wikilink") and
pathing of the previous one, requiring the tier 5 technology [](Large_Defensive_Walls_(Tech).md) in order to be
built. Defensive merlon structures on top offer some protection from
enemy fire. Once [](Strong_Defensive_Walls_(Tech).md) is researched, it can
be directly upgraded to Defensive Wall IV.

### **Construction Info**

- Material Cost: 3 [Building Materials](Building_Materials.md "wikilink")
- Estimated build time: 3 hours
- Power consumption: 0
- Bonus to mounted turrets: 10%

## Defensive Wall IV

It inherits the ability of placing [Turrets](Turrets.md "wikilink") and
pathing of the previous one, requiring the tier 6 technology [](Strong_Defensive_Walls_(Tech).md) in order to
be build. Defensive embrasures on top offer significant protection from
enemy fire as well as a fixed place to install the [](Mounted_Crossbows_(Tech).md). While
[FCS](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md "wikilink") does list an upgrade to
these, it can't be achieved during normal gameplay.

When constructing these walls, pay attention to how the loopholes are
placed. Once the wall is long enough, four embrasures will be placed in
a row and another set of embrasures will begin with a new section.
Placing a shorter section of the wall will result in no loopholes
placed. While sometimes this may be necessary, there is no reason not to
have all your walls have all the combat stations necessary.

### **Construction Info**

- Material Cost: 4 [Building Materials](Building_Materials.md "wikilink")
- Estimated build time: 4 hours
- Power consumption: 0
- Bonus to mounted turrets: 20%

## History

Defensive Walls have been a part of Kenshi since version 0.40 but
received a visual and stat change with version 0.65.0. The new version
of the Defensive Wall is constructed with pieces of metal and a railed
off walkway.

While there is no way to build the older version of the wall through the
game's build menu. It is possible to place them through the in-game
editor.

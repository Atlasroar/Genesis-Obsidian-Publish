**Version 0.22** introduced the foliage system into the game. Before
this update, the whole [Old World](Old_World.md "wikilink") used to look
like a sandy wasteland with a few buildings spread around.

There were no revisions to this version.

__TOC__

I finally have the next update done, it took a little longer than I
would have liked though, hope you enjoy the update. **THIS VERSION IS
NOT IN THE AUTO-UPDATER.  YOU NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT HERE!** Unfortunately
because the update is a lot bigger I don’t have the bandwidth to spare
for such a large auto-update size.  In the future I’ll rent a dedicated
server and this won’t be a problem, but for now at least I wanted to try
and keep my costs low. You can get it here:

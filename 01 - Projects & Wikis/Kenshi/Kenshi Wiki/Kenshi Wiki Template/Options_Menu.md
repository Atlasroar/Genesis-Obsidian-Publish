The **Options Menu** is a [](Guide_to_UI_and_Controls.md) which can be used to
change settings for the game.

Allows you to change a variety of things including Font Size, and modify
settings that have to do with the game graphically and audibly. Also
includes a subsection that allows you see what mods you currently have
enabled, which can be useful to avoid save-file corruption or overlaps.

**Infinite Wingwang** is a [Greenlander](Human.md "wikilink") male that can
be found in a [bar](Bars.md "wikilink") at the town of
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"). He was the very first [](Unique_Recruits.md) and has been around since the very
[early builds of the game](Sword_For_Hire.md "wikilink"). If talked to he
will offer himself up for hire for 100,000 Cats. There are multiple
paths you can take down through his dialog, and you can bargain his cost
down to 5,000.

He is one of the strongest recruits, surpassed only by
[Agnu](Agnu.md "wikilink") (50 strength) and
[Crumblejon](Crumblejon.md "wikilink") (24).

## Dialogue

Infinite Wingwang will initially offer his service to your character for
100,000 Cats but it is possible to talk him down to 5,000 Cats. In order
to talk Infinite Wingwang down in his fee choose either, "I'll give you
4,000, and I'm changing your name." or, "What!? I could get 10 Infinite
Wingwangs for that!" and then select the, "Um, 5000?" option when
available. [ru:Вечный Суньвынь](ru:Вечный_Суньвынь "wikilink")

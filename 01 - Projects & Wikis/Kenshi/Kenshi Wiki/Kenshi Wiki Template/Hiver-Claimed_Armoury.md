**Hiver-Claimed Armoury** is a location controlled by the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md). There are three of these locations in
[Kenshi](Kenshi.md "wikilink") - two in [Greyshelf](Greyshelf.md "wikilink")
and one in the [Royal Valley](Royal_Valley.md "wikilink").

Hiver-Claimed Armoury can contain these characters: [](Armoury_Droneguard.md), [Prince](Prince.md "wikilink"),
[Droneguard](Droneguard.md "wikilink"), [Drone](Drone.md "wikilink").

If [Valamon](Valamon.md "wikilink") is killed or kidnapped, [](Reaver_Camp.md) locations can be taken over by the
Southern Hive and turned into a location similar to a Hiver-Claimed
Armoury.

**Shek Warriors**are warriors of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md). They are the most numerous members of
the Kingdom, being found as guards and residents of shops and towns, as
well as being led by their stronger brethren - the [](Hundred_Guardian.md) - into battle.

If a player's base encroaches on Shek territory, these warriors will
lead raids demanding tribute in the form of food.

If [Esata the Stone Golem](Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") is [](World_States.md) then the Shek Warriors will swear
allegiance to [Flying Bull](Flying_Bull.md "wikilink") and will start to
spawn as members of the [Kral's Chosen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md "wikilink").

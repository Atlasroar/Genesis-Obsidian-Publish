## Trivia

- **Skeleton Log-Head MKII** is one of the two Skeletons (alongside with
  **Skeleton MKII Screame**r) to have the 'k' of Mk capitalized.
- **Skeleton Log-Head MKII** has the exact same bleed rate, vision range
  and HP on all body parts (except for Head) like their other MKII
  cousin, [Skeleton MKII Screamer](Skeleton_MKII_Screamer.md "wikilink").
-

<!-- -->

- While their heads are 200 HP and the rest of the body corresponds to
  the more delicate type of skeleton with 150 HP, it might be possible
  that this variant came about to increase the number of skeleton
  soldiers during the war with makeshift means. Its entirely possible
  that the available more delicate bodies were attached to more durable
  soldier heads to replace the combat losses or to gain an advantage in
  numbers.

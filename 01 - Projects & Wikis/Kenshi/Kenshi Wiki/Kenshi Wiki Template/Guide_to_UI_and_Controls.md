Hopefully, this **Guide to User Interface and Controls** can answer any
questions players have about default control settings and Kenshi's
extensive UI.

## Controls

All keyboard controls can be changed in the [](Options_Menu.md). The default keys for controls are listed
[here](Controls.md "wikilink").

## User Interfaces

The first actionable screen which users encounter is the [](Main_Menu.md).

When starting a new game, players will be taken to [](Character_Customization.md). After completing
character customization, players will be shown the [](Loading_Screen.md). The loading screen will also appear
after loading or importing a previous save.

During game, players can hit the C key to open the
[Statistics](Statistics.md "wikilink") window. This window will display all
skills and levels which the selected character has, as well as
descriptions for each skill when the skill is hovered-over with the
mouse.

In order to find out about what resources are nearby, players can make
use of their selected character's [Science](Science.md "wikilink") stat and
[Prospect](Prospecting.md "wikilink") the area. This opens a screen with
statistics, wind speeds, and a heat map, the scale of which is
determined by skill level.

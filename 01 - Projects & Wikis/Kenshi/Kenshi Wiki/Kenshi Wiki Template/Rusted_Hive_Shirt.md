clothing. This is also the Hive-equivalent of [](Rusty_Chain_Shirt.md) and [](Rusty_Chainmail.md), and, as such, has no arm

that fits the upper part of a hiver's chest. A semi-circular hole is
open to match the hiver's torso, which is instead covered by a metal
plate fastened by four leather belts. The stomach is covered by a metal
cage attached to a thick leather border.

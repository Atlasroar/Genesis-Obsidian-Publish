**Shryke** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink"). She is a
treasure hunter stranded in [Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"). She seems to
have had a brother who didn't make it into Mongrel, most likely captured
and eaten alive by the innumerous hordes of fogmen surrounding the town.
She has a scar on her hand that she may have gotten getting into the fog
town, or from an older expedition.

She will leave with the player for free, but is more hesitant when there
are less than 3 members in the player squad (she will join you
regardless).

She has a Smart [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink") and after
recruited has the "Player TOUGH Merc" dialogue package. She also has 5
unique dialogue lines, 3 of which are exclusive to her.

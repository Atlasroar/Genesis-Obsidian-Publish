The **Crab Villages** are two [](Minor_Outposts.md) controlled by the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md). They are located in
[Greenbeach](Greenbeach.md "wikilink") and [](Stobe's_Gamble.md) â€“ the latter can be found on an
elevated plateau next to what looks like an overturned and decayed
[Flats Lagoon](Flats_Lagoon.md "wikilink") platform.

Players can purchase [Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink") in this location.

If allied with the Crab Raiders, the beds in this village are all free
to use. However, the town's population, as well as any injured [](Crab_Raider.md) squads currently visiting town will
likely be taking up these beds.

[Reavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink") can take over this town if [](Crab_Queen.md) is kidnapped or dead.

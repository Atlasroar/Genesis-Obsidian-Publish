**Item Storage** is [Core Tech](Core_Tech.md "wikilink") which gives
players the ability to construct general [Storage](Storage.md "wikilink")
containers as well as [Food](Food.md "wikilink")-specific containers.

This research is free and quick and should be done by all players.
General Storage Chest and Boxes are convenient for use when players only
have a couple of a specific item and don't want to construct a specific
storage container. Food Store and Animal Feeders hold all types of food
and characters will run to take from them whenever they're hungry enough
to eat.

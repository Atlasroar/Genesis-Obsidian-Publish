**Heft** is the current Capital of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) and is located in [](The_Great_Desert.md) region. The economy of this town is
relied upon the supplies from both [Port South](Port_South.md "wikilink")
and the stable economy of [Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"). It is located
directly east of [Stoat](Stoat.md "wikilink"), Southeast of
[Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink"), and Northeast of
[Heng](Heng.md "wikilink").

**Heft** is home to [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink"), leader of
the United Cities, as well as [Lord Ohta](Lord_Ohta.md "wikilink"), one of
the members of the [Noble Circle](Noble_Circle.md "wikilink").
[Koin](Koin.md "wikilink"), who is in charge of the United Cities'
diplomatic affairs, can also be found here.

Next to the Faction HQ is a 'yard' separated from the rest of the town
by makeshift walls and gate alongside the [](Samurai_Gate_Sergeant.md) and the [](Samurai_Gate_Guard.md) guarding the gate. Inside this
area a building alongside several camp beds can be found, the latter
being most likely slums for the homeless to sleep constructed by the
government or [peasants](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md "wikilink") themselves.

This town is noteworthy for having a unique [](Heft_Armory.md) which sells the best armor in the entire
UC, alongside a Thieves Guild where the player could buy sneaky
equipments from, and a Robotics Workshop where characters in need of
robotic repairs or replacements can go to.

The player can find it by exploration or by acquiring and reading the
**[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the United Cities (Central Territories)**.

**Fallen towers** are watchtowers fallen into disrepair and often lying
on the ground. It is more of a landmark ruin since it is not accessible
and there are no lootable items around. The place doesn't seem to serve
any purpose except for lore aesthetics. There is one in [](Stenn_Desert.md), [Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink"),
[Leviathan Coast](Leviathan_Coast.md "wikilink"), and in
[Arach](Arach.md "wikilink").

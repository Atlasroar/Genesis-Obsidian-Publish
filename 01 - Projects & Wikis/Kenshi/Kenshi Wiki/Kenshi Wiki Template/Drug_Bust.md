**Drug Bust** is an [event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if a
member of the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") military or
police sees an illegal building owned by the player. These buildings
include [](Biofuel_Distillery_(Hemp).md), [](Hemp_Farm.md), [](Hemp_Processor.md), and [](Hydroponic_Hemp.md). [](Emperor_Tengu.md) must also not be killed or captured for
the event to trigger.

Once the illegal building is spotted, there are a few potential routes
the dialog could take, depending on whether or not it is inside an NPC
owned town, as well as the [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink") of the
Samurai who spottted it.

A Smart, Honourable, or Fearful personality Samurai if inside an NPC
town will immediately assign a bounty of 2,000 [Cats](Cats.md "wikilink")
to the one or more player characters, and attempt to arrest them. If not
inside an NPC town, they will leave and report back to their superiors,
which will trigger this event in 12-28 hours. If the player's squad is
less than 9 characters, then the Samurai will immediately assign the
bounty and attack even outside an NPC town.

A Traitorous, Dumb, Brave, or Maniacal personaltiy Samurai will attempt
to extort the player. If the player ignores them, the Samurai will
eventually assign a bounty of 2,000 [Cats](Cats.md "wikilink") to the
player and attack them. If talked to there are many routes you can take.

Accepting to pay them a bribe of 2,000 [Cats](Cats.md "wikilink") will
result in them attempting to extort you for an extra 1,000
[Cats](Cats.md "wikilink"). If you lack the funds to pay the full 3,000
[Cats](Cats.md "wikilink"), then they'll let you off with just the 2,000.
Insisting on paying only the 2,000 has a chance to convince them to take
it and leave, and a chance they might attack and assign the bounty. If
they choose to attack, but the player has more than 7 characters in
their squad, the Samurai will instead report to his superiors and this
event will trigger in 48-72 hours.

Refusal to pay or taunting/mocking them will result in them immediately
attacking your characters and assigning the bounty, unless the player
has more than 7 characters in their squad, in which case the Samurai
will instead report back to HQ and this event will trigger in 48-72
hours.

Alternatively, you can attempt to convince the Samurai you are someone
of importance. Claiming you are a noble will only work if your outpost
is level 3 or higher (the big town icon on the map), if your base is any
lower level then they will simply attack or trigger the event. If you've
killed (not captured) the [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") or the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), or if you've
killed/captured [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) or
[Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink"), you can attempt to intimidate them into
leaving you alone, though this only has a chance to work and will
trigger the attack and bounty or event if it fails.

If the event is triggered, the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink")
will send an assault to your base. This assault will consist of 1-3
squads, each made up of 1-3 [Samurai Scouts](Samurai_Scout.md "wikilink"),
2-5 [Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), and 10-20 [](Samurai_Conscript.md), and will be led by an
additional [Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"). There is a very low chance
that one or more of the squads will be substituted for a different
squad, made up of 1-3 [Samurai Scouts](Samurai_Scout.md "wikilink"), 5-8
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), and 1-4 [](Samurai_Conscript.md), led by a [](Samurai_Sergeant.md).

Once the assault arrives the war leader will make a short speech about
being here to arrest you, and then order their soldiers to attack. If
victorious, the assault will leave shortly after winning. If defeated,
the [United Cities Assault](United_Cities_Assault.md "wikilink") event will
trigger in 72-100 hours.

**Return for Tribute** is an event that triggers if you accept paying
tribute in the [Tribute Round](Tribute_Round.md "wikilink") event, or if
you have failed to defeat the [](Return_For_Blood.md) or [](Shek_Challengers_(Shek_Kingdom).md) events. It also
requires that [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink"), [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md), [Seto](Seto.md "wikilink"),
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"), and the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) to all not be killed or captured.
If even one of them has been, the raid will fail to trigger. It will
also fail to trigger if the player is allied to the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

If all the conditions are met, the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) will trigger an assault on the
player's base. This assault will consist of 1 squad, made up of 5-8
[Shek Warriors](Shek_Warrior.md "wikilink") and 0-1 [](Shek_Scout.md), led by an additional [](Shek_Warrior.md).

Once the assault arrives, the leader will give a short speech, based on
whether you previously resisted giving tribute. If ignored or refused,
the [Return for Blood](Return_For_Blood.md "wikilink") event will trigger
in 24-30 hours, assuming you had not previously resisted paying tribute.
If you had previously refused, it will instead trigger in 12-24 hours.

If tribute is paid, the assault's forces will wander around the base,
looting food from any food storage containers they can find. Eventually
they will leave, and another **Return for Tribute** event will trigger
in 100-150 hours. (Note: It is possible to pick up all your food before
paying tribute, and the assault's forces will not react to it. Even if
they find nothing, they will leave satisfied.)

Like most tax Events, if the campaign is defeated by a third party
faction like bandits or wild animals on the way to the player's outpost,
it will prevent any future tax visits from the faction until the
player's next import. This is due to the long repeat limit timer, and
the fact that it doesn't consider being defeated by a third party as the
player killing them. This can be exploited by purposefully luring
hostiles to the event's forces while they en route to the player's base.
Though in the case of the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") here,
it is possible to reactivate the tribute events by failing to defeat a
[Shek Challengers](Shek_Challengers_(Shek_Kingdom).md "wikilink") event.

**Valamon** is the leader of the [Reavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink"). He can
be found in the capital of Reavers, [Ark](Ark.md "wikilink").

He is only wanted by the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"):

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If **Valamon** is killed or kidnapped, some of the locations controlled
by the Reavers will be [overtaken](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") by other
factions:

**Ark** becomes overtaken by the [Crab Raiders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink")
if the [Crab Queen](Crab_Queen.md "wikilink") is alive. If she is also
killed or kidnapped, it becomes inhabited by a bunch of
[squatters](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Vagrants.md "wikilink").

[Reaver Camps](Reaver_Camp.md "wikilink") will be overtaken by the
[Southern Hive](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink") if the [](Queen_of_the_South.md) is alive and free, if she is also
killed or kidnapped, all Reaver Camps will become
[ruins](Reaver_Camp/Destroyed "wikilink").

If [Brink](Brink.md "wikilink") is under the control of Reavers, it will
become [ruins](Brink/Destroyed "wikilink") under [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) rule.

Reaver patrols will also cease to spawn in [](Stormgap_Coast.md), [The Eye](The_Eye.md "wikilink") and
[Heng](Heng.md "wikilink") if the world states for them to spawn there were
already achieved beforehand. Crab Raider patrols will start spawning in
Stormgap Coast and Heng if the Crab Queen is alive.

If **Valamon** is killed or kidnapped, The [](Blooded_Raid.md) event will also cease to trigger.

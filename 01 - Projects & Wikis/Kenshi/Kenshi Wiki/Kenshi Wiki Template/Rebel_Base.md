**Rebel Base** is a one-house-bar town. Despite technically being a
[Holy Nation Outlaws](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md "wikilink") settlement, the
only occupants are [Trade Ninjas](Trade_Ninjas.md "wikilink"), the same
people who operate the Bar in [The Hub](The_Hub.md "wikilink") close to it.
Guards frequently engage the various bandits that roam the area.

The vendor which spawns here is a [](Black_Market_Bar.md) vendor who sells a wide variety of
goods, notably crossbows, weapon blueprints, building materials, and
food (including [Greenfruit](Greenfruit.md "wikilink")). It's also
noteworthy for accepting stolen goods from any faction that isn't their
own.

There are two [Copper](Copper.md "wikilink") nodes next to the site, which
makes it a promising location for an early mining career.

## Tips

- Although the Trade Ninjas are the sole occupants of Rebel Base, the
  [Holy Nation Outlaws](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md "wikilink") are listed in
  the FCS as the ones actually owning the settlement.
- Take care when kiting enemies here to be taken care of by the [](Ninja_Guard.md). For one the guards will side with law
  enforcement like Holy Nation paladins against the player, and
  secondly, although the guards are capable of defeating wandering
  patrols of [Starving](Starving_Bandits.md "wikilink") or [](Dust_Bandits.md), bringing larger or multiple groups,
  or alternatively trying to get them to take on [](Black_Dragon_Ninjas.md) from an outpost raid will
  often result in the group losing and the barman dying without player
  aid.

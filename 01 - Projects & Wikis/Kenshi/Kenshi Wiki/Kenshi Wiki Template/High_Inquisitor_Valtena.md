**High Inquisitor Valtena** is a member of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and its
[Inquisition](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"), and an important military
commander for the [Holy Lord Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink"). He
is located in [Okran's Shield](Okran's_Shield.md "wikilink"), but can also
lead an attack against the player in an event called the [](Wrath_of_God.md). He can be captured and turned over to
the [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink"), [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) or [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) for a sizable Bounty of 40,000 Cats.

Valtena is the commander of the Holy Army's northern forces, and
responsible for the campaign in [Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink") against
the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"). He is likely responsible
for destroying the region's [namesake](Bast.md "wikilink") city, and aims
to take [Drin](Drin.md "wikilink") as well.

Players wishing to destroy the Holy Nation will need to defeat this
character as well as two others ([](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) and the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md)).

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction. The color used is "Holy Nation Level 3".

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If High Inquisitor Valtena is killed/imprisoned there are several World
States that will trigger.

[Okran's Shield](Okran's_Shield.md "wikilink") would be turned over to
United Cities control if High Inquisitor Valtena is killed/imprisoned,
or to the Shek Kingdom if the player is allied with them (because of a
quirk in the system, this cannot happen unless Tengu is
killed/imprisoned as well). If Okran's Shield is under United Cities
control it can be turned over to the [Reavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink") if
[Lady Tsugi](Lady_Tsugi.md "wikilink") is killed/imprisoned while
[Valamon](Valamon.md "wikilink") is alive and free.

[Okran's Fist](Okran's_Fist.md "wikilink") would become half-destroyed or
handed over to [Cannibals](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") control if Holy Lord
Phoenix is also killed/imprisoned.

If [Drin](Drin.md "wikilink") is under the control of Holy Nation, it would
become destroyed after High Inquisitor Valtena's death/imprisonment.

If High Inquisitor Valtena, Holy Lord Phoenix and High Inquisitor Seta
are all either killed/imprisoned while [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") is alive
and free, Flotsam Ninjas will take over [](Blister_Hill.md) and [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink"). If
Moll is also killed/imprisoned, both towns would fall under the control
of [Holy Nation Outlaws](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md "wikilink").

If High Inquisitor Valtena, Holy Lord Phoenix and High Inquisitor Seta
are all either killed/imprisoned while [](Flying_Bull.md) is alive and free, [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md) patrols will start spawning at
[Okran's Valley](Okran's_Valley.md "wikilink") and
[Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink").

If High Inquisitor Valtena and High Inquisitor Seta are all either
killed/imprisoned while [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") is alive and free,
[Flotsam Ninjas](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") patrols would start spawning
in [Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink") and [](Okran's_Valley.md) region.

His death/imprisonment would also cease Holy army patrols in
[Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink").

His death/imprisonment also causes the Holy army patrols to become less
frequent in [Okran's Valley](Okran's_Valley.md "wikilink") and
[Bast](Bast.md "wikilink") regions.

If High Inquisitor Valtena is killed/imprisoned alongside with Holy Lord
Phoenix and High Inquisitor Seta, the Holy army would cripple and cease
to spawn and be replaced with [](Strayed_Paladin.md) patrol consisted of 4 to 10
people patrolling the following zones: [Bast](Bast.md "wikilink"), [](Border_Zone.md), [Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink"), [](Okran's_Gulf.md), [](Okran's_Pride.md), [](Okran's_Valley.md), and [](Skinner's_Roam.md).

## Trivia

**Ghost Village** is implied to have been recently raided by
[Cannibals](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink"). As a result, the buildings are
deserted, yet full of items. It has one [Bar](Bar.md "wikilink") but no
actual population.

The story of the Ghost Village can be found in the [Mega City: The
Beginning Series](Mega_City:_The_Beginning_Series "wikilink").

## Notes

- You can unlock the containers inside of the shacks/bar for loot but be
  careful that a Tech Hunter does not patrol into the town and sees you
  doing so. They will attack you if you are caught in the act.

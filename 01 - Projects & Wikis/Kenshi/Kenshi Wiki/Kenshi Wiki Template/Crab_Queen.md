The **Crab Queen** is the leader of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md). She can be found in the [](Palace_of_the_Crab_Queen.md) in [](Crab_Town.md). She has a bounty of 40,000 Cats from the
[United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), despite not having a bounty
poster for her unlike other pit gang leaders.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
her faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction.

## Interactions

The **Crab Queen** can be spoken to in order to secure an alliance with
the Crab Raiders.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If the Crab Queen is killed or imprisoned, Crab Town falls to the
[Fishmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink") and [](Crab_Village.md) falls to the
[Reavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink"). Patrols of Crab Raiders consisting of
8-14 [Crab Raiders](Crab_Raider.md "wikilink") and 4-10
[Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink") and a separate scouting force of 1-2 Crab
Raiders and a Crab stop spawning, being replaced by a broken,
malnourished squad of 1 Crab Raider with 3-5 slightly younger Crabs. The
[Crab Tournaments](Crab_Tournament.md "wikilink") and the [](Crabbed_Ones.md) events will also cease to trigger.

If [Valamon](Valamon.md "wikilink") is killed or imprisoned,
[Ark](Ark.md "wikilink") becomes overtaken by the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md) if the [](Crab_Queen.md) is alive. If she is also killed or
kidnapped, it becomes inhabited by a bunch of squatters. Crab Raiders
patrols will also start spawning in [](Stormgap_Coast.md) and [Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink").

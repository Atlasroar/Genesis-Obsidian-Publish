## Tips

- Megacrabs aren't very good at detecting characters in stealth mode and
  stick to a very small patrol area, making them very easy to sneak
  past.
- Nests of crabs spawn within the buildings. When these buildings are
  open the crabs will swarm into the middle area making it more
  difficult to fight the [Megacrabs](Megacrab.md "wikilink").
- If you wait long enough in game it is possible for the baby crabs
  nesting in the buildings to age to "Elder," these are much more
  dangerous than the adult crabs that patrol the maze.
- [Acid rain](Acid_Rain.md "wikilink") and continuous crab patrols can tend
  to make this area difficult.

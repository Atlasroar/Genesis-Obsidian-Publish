**Tengu's Vault** is located at the south end of rocky
[Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink") and is guarded by the
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink") of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md). The Vault seems to be a military
prison presumably for the worst criminals of the empire. [](The_Vault_Warden.md) oversees the prison.

When approaching, the gate guards will tell you not to approach and are
going to attack if you're trespassing anyways. As of 0.97.6 if you have
good standing with the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") the
guards will only react verbally but will not attack the player which
allows you to see what is inside.

Currently the inside resembles a police building, floor 0 bed
area/training area, floor 1 cooking/eating area, floor 2 prison area.

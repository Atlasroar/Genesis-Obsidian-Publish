![](93_factions.png "93_factions.png")![](Kenshi_Political_Location_Map.jpg "Kenshi_Political_Location_Map.jpg")
In [Kenshi](Kenshi.md "wikilink"), there are several different factions you
can join and fight against. Some factions will be hostile to any person
they see, such as: Cannibals, Berserkers and Swamp Ninjas.

The different factions can wage war against one another, so be careful
with whom you choose to side.

By attacking a different faction you will become an enemy of that
faction for some time. Some factions have [](Guide_to_Faction_Relations.md), but most do not. So
pick your battles wisely.

## Player Faction

The player's faction. All your characters belong to it.

- [Nameless](Nameless.md "wikilink")

## Major Factions

The main factions of the world, they tend to have several cities and
outposts across the world, and will likely be the primary factions you
interact with during gameplay.

### Holy Nation

[The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") is a
[Human](Human.md "wikilink") faction made up of religious and xenophobic
fanatics who worship a deity named [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink"). They treat
[Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") and [Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink") as corrupted and
subhuman, enforce women's submission to men, and attack
[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") or those with robotic limbs on the
spot. Their primary enemy faction is the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) which is made up of rebel women and
escaped slaves. They are also at war with the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md).

### Shek Kingdom

The [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") is made up of
[Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") warriors. Their kingdom is in ruins after a long
war with The Holy Nation, but their [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) is trying to reestablish their
society by slowing their warlike culture. They are opposed by many rogue
Shek factions who oppose peaceful living such as the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md), [Berserkers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink"),
and [Kral's Chosen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md "wikilink").

### United Cities

The [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), also known as the Empire,
is the largest faction in Kenshi. The Empire is ruled by a cruel cabal
of nobles, chaired by an
[Emperor](https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Emperor_Tengu). The United
Cities are closely allied with many factions such as [](Bounty_Hunters.md), [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md), and the [](Traders_Guild.md). The Empire values wealth. They are
opposed by the poor of their region, the
[Anti-Slavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") and the [](Rebel_Farmers.md). Its territory is populated by
[Empire Peasants](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md "wikilink").

### Western Hive

The [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") is a faction of the
insect-like [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink") race. The Western Hive proper is
located on an island off the western coast, but a majority of the Hive
lives on the continent, in series of [](Hive_Village.md) stretched along the river in
[Vain](Vain.md "wikilink").

### Machinists and Tech Hunters

Based out of [World's End](World's_End.md "wikilink"), the
[Machinists](Machinists.md "wikilink") work to determine the history of
Kenshi and theorize about different factions. Machinists take their
findings and distill some information into [Books](Books.md "wikilink")
which are distributed across the world. [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) venture out into the wilderness in
search of [Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink") and Technologies. Tech
Hunters have built Waystations to serve as bases for them to rest
between journeys. In addition to [World's End](World's_End.md "wikilink"),
they control several [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") in the
southeastern part of the continent.

## Minor Factions

The minor players in the world. Usually only have a couple of outposts
or cities at most. There are quite a few across the world, so you'll
likely meet several of them as you explore, though you'd be forgiven for
not noticing some of them.

### Border Zone

The [Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink") is the region between the
[Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) territories. Aside from those
factions, the Border Zone is home to three minor factions. [](The_Hub.md), a city previously under Holy Nation control,
is now owned by [Holy Nation Outlaws](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md "wikilink").
At The Hub and the nearby [Rebel Base](Rebel_Base.md "wikilink"), [](Trade_Ninjas.md) can be found. The majority of the
Border Zone is terrorized by [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandits.md "wikilink") and
[Starving Bandits](Starving_Bandits.md "wikilink"). The Border Zone is also
home to the [Black Dragon Ninjas](Black_Dragon_Ninjas.md "wikilink") and a
[Waystation](Waystation_(Border_Zone).md "wikilink").

### Deadcat

In the northwestern corner of Kenshi, the
[Plains](Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink") have been overrun by Cannibals. The
[Deadcat](Deadcat.md "wikilink") civilization has dwindled to their current
state of existing only in the corners of their former lands. Deadcat
Mercenaries and [Cannibal Hunters](Cannibal_Hunters.md "wikilink") work in
the area to decrease the Painted Tribes' power.

### Flotsam Ninjas

The [Flotsam Ninjas](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") are a faction mostly
made up of women who escaped the oppression of The Holy Nation and
former slaves from Rebirth. They live in a [](Flotsam_Village.md) near the Cannibal Plains, as the
painted tribes provide a good deterrent from their oppressors.

### Mongrel

In the middle of the infamous [Fog Islands](Fog_Islands.md "wikilink"),
outlaws and survivors have built the city of
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"). The Shinobi ninja guards of
[Mongrel](Mongrel_(Faction).md "wikilink") keep the
[Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") at bay while the artisan locals perfect
their craft inside the city walls.

### Slavers

Slaves work in Stone Mines or Farms owned by The Holy Nation and the
United Cities. Characters can be captured and enslaved by [](Slave_Hunters.md) and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md). If characters escape from slavery,
they can be hunted down by [Manhunters](Manhunters.md "wikilink") and Slave
Hunters. Slaver factions are opposed primarily by the [](Anti_Slavers.md).

### Swampers

Inside [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink") there are
[Swampers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Swampers.md "wikilink"), but the area is mainly controlled by
the criminal gangs. The top gang is the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink"),
which can be joined by the Player faction. The other swamp gangs are the
[Blackshifters](Blackshifters.md "wikilink"),
[Grayflayers](Grayflayers.md "wikilink"), [](Stone_Rats.md), and the
[Twinblades](Twinblades.md "wikilink"). The Swamp is also plagued by two
bandit groups: [Red Sabres](Red_Sabres.md "wikilink") and [](Swamp_Ninjas.md).

## Hostile Factions

Ancient Security Robots, Bandits, Cannibals, and the like. These are the
factions that are out to kill or rob you. Some have outposts where they
are based out of, but players are not generally welcome. You'll likely
spend a large amount of time fighting these factions.

## Non-Factions

While technically factions, these will not show up in the factions list,
and cannot have their relations changed. Often used for empty locations,
ruins, wildlife, or to represent groups that have no actual organization
(e.g. Drifters, Slaves, etc.). Some are hostile, and others are passive
and have no care in the world for what you're doing.

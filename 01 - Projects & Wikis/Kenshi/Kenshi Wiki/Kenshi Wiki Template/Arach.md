**Arach** is the home of the [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"). This is
one of the most dangerous zones in Kenshi because of how frequently
groups of [Skin Spiders](Skin_Spider.md "wikilink") spawn.

## Inhabitants

Arach has no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink"). There are no
[Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps set to spawn in this area.

### Minor Outposts

*These locations are typically small towns, villages, or faction bases.*

- [Throne of the Bugmaster](Throne_of_the_Bugmaster.md "wikilink")

### Ancient Locations

#### Aesthetic Ruins

*These locations show up on the map, although the player cannot interact
with anything at this location.*

- [Fallen Tower](Fallen_Tower.md "wikilink")

### Homeless Spawns

It is very likely for a group of 1 to 10 [](Skin_Spider.md) to spawn in Arach. There is a 1/6
chance of a large group of Skin Spiders to spawn. The large group can
contain 20 to 30 spiders.

## Environment

### Weather

*This zone has the Vain season. Seasons may cause harmful [](Weather_Effects.md) or be purely aesthetic.*

- Red Rain (no acidic effect)
- Clear skies

## Tips

- [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") characters cannot be eaten, so they
  are extremely useful here.
- Avoid [Swimming](Swimming.md "wikilink"), as spiders can walk through
  water and attack your swimming characters.
- Weapons with racial bonuses against animals or spiders such as
  [Polearms](Polearms.md "wikilink") and [](Desert_Sabre.md) work extremely well here.
- Skin Spider are relatively slow, large creatures. Do not let yourself
  be surrounded. Use hit and run tactics to clear groups, or stealth to
  avoid conflict.
- If you are brave enough and avoid getting surrounded, you can level up
  your stealth here extremely fast.

## Trivia

- The name of this region comes from the Ancient Greek word for "spider"
  (ἀράχνη).

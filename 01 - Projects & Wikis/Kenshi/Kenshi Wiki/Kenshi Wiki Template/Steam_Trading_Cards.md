![](Trading_cards.png "Trading_cards.png") **Steam Trading Cards** are
trade-able content available to people who purchased
[Kenshi](Kenshi.md "wikilink") on Steam. They make use of concept art from
Kenshi's development, depicting [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink"),
[Bonedogs](Bonedog.md "wikilink"), [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink"),
[Gorillos](Gorillo.md "wikilink"), and [Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink"). Some
images used in the trading cards are also in use as [](Loading_Screen.md).

Users who collect all five cards can consume them to craft a badge, and
in doing so earn XP, emoticons, profile backgrounds, and discount
coupons for the Steam store. The badge can be crafted five times for the
standard cards, each one after the first leveling the badge up, changing
the icon slightly and proving more XP and other unlocks. In addition,
users can craft one platinum badge using the rare foil variants of the
cards. The platinum badge provides more XP, but is otherwise identical
in effect to the normal ones.

All cards, emoticons, and backgrounds can be traded, bought, or sold on
the Steam marketplace.

Anticipated or ongoing **Events** can be found on the right side of the
[Factions](Factions.md "wikilink") window. Events include scheduled visits
to a [player's outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") by
another faction and ongoing Bodyguard Jobs. The timer will show how much
time is left until an event starts or the time left on a Bodyguard job.

Information regarding only *one* bodyguard job will be presented at a
time, although the player can have multiple bodyguards hired at once. In
contrast, several *different* visits can be scheduled and listed in the
Events list. Since [animals](Fauna.md "wikilink") give no notice of their
plans to visit a player outpost, raids by [](Blood_Spider.md) and [](River_Raptor.md) will not appear in this menu.

## Bodyguards

Bodyguards are characters that are set to guard members of your faction
or your outpost for a limited amount of time. They can either be hired
or will join you as allies out of their own free will. Once you have
acquired a bodyguard, an Event will be shown under the Faction tab
stating the number of hours before they leave. Some bodyguards,
depending on personality, may stay longer if all members of the player's
squad are KOed upon expiry of contract. For a full list of characters
capable of being bodyguards, see
[Bodyguards](:Category:Bodyguards "wikilink").

### Mercenaries

Mercenaries are bodyguards that are usually hired at bars using cats.
They usually give a choice between bodyguarding the player or their
nearest outpost.

- [Mercenary Guild](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Mercenary_Guild.md "wikilink") - after talking to a
  [Mercenary Captain](Mercenary_Captain.md "wikilink") or a [](Human_Mercenary.md) squad leader. The Human
  Mercenary variant is only found in [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). They cost 1000 cats per day up to
  two days to guard the player, and 2000 cats every two days up to eight
  days to guard the player's outpost.
- [Tech Hunters](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink") - after talking to a
  [Drifter](Drifter.md "wikilink") squad leader of this faction that are
  found in bars. They cost the same as normal mercenaries.
- [Cannibal Hunters](Cannibal_Hunters.md "wikilink") - after talking to a
  [Cannibal Hunter](Cannibal_Hunter.md "wikilink") squad leader. They cost
  3000 cats per day to guard the player, and 3000 cats every two days up
  to eight days to guard the player's outpost.
- [Black Dogs](Black_Dog.md "wikilink") - after talking to a [](Black_Dog_Bodyguard.md) trying to extort the
  player. They cost 2500 cats per day to guard the player, and upon
  completion of the contract will demand an exit fee of 700 cats, or can
  be re-hired. Note that refusing to pay the exit fee or not hiring them
  in the first place will cause them to attack. They also have a unique
  bodyguard event where they show up at a player's outpost to extort
  protection. This will cost 4000 cats for two days, but can be lowered
  down to 3500 or 3000 cats.

### Allies

If a player has allied with these factions, some of their patrols can be
asked to follow the player or may randomly follow the player on their
own.

- [Anti-Slavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") - if [Big Bo](Bo.md "wikilink")
  is in the squad, she will sometimes hail Anti-Slaver squads for three
  days (interestingly may include Tinfist's squad //confirm).
  Alternatively, if the player has taken down any high-ranking UC leader
  or noble groups, random Anti-Slaver squads will also bodyguard the
  player for three days.
- [Crab Raiders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink") - random protection from [](Crab_Raider.md) patrols. They will guard the crabbed
  for 6 hours.
- [Flotsam Ninjas](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") - after showing [](Note_From_Moll.md) to [](Flotsam_Ninja.md) squad leaders consisting of more than
  4 individuals in a patrol.

<!-- -->

- [Rebel Farmers](Rebel_Farmers.md "wikilink") - after speaking to a
  patrolling Rebel Farmer squad leader. If the option implying
  importance they will bodyguard the player for three days, else they
  may refuse or only bodyguard the player for one day.
- [Rebel Swordsmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md "wikilink") - after speaking to a
  [Rebel Captain](Rebel_Captain.md "wikilink") squad leader that is not
  guarding a town. They will bodyguard the player for one day.

<!-- -->

- [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") - after speaking to a [](Hundred_Guardian.md) squad leader that is not
  guarding a town. They will bodyguard the player for 3 days or defend
  the player's outpost for two days.
- [Starving Bandits](Starving_Bandits.md "wikilink") - after giving food to
  the leader of patrol (don't expect them to last long).

<!-- -->

- [The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") - showing the [](Holy_Seal.md) to a [Paladin](Paladin.md "wikilink") patrol
  leader. They will bodyguard the player for 36 hours.
- [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") - random protection from
  patrols, usually led by a [](Samurai_Sergeant.md) ([](Samurai_Rogue.md) can technically bodyguard the
  player, if they are somehow allied to UC while the conditions for
  Rogues to spawn are met). They will bodyguard the player for three
  days.

### Other

Unique bodyguard events with special "contract" conditions.

- [Tech Hunter Ruins](Tech_Hunter_Ruins.md "wikilink") - if the player
  finds a lone tech hunter near ancient ruins, they may be able to talk
  to them. Accepting their company will cause them to bodyguard the
  player for 24 hours.
- [Error_Code_0xFFFFFF](Error_Code_0xFFFFFF.md "wikilink") - after being
  seen by them. They ally themselves to the player character that saw
  them with a bodyguard "contract" that lasts over a hundred in-game
  years.

## Types of Outpost Visits/Assaults: Major Factions

Major factions visit the [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md) for a multitude of
reasons. The most common reason for a visit is when a major faction
establishes that another settlement has sprung up in previously barren
land and that it has to be included in **their** sphere of influence.
Each major faction will send representatives of their government to
demand a token of loyalty of a new settlement to their authority. Should
this gesture of obedience be refused, the major powers will then visit
player's outpost for a second reason - to destroy and pillage the
upstart criminal. These assaults can only be stopped by destroying the
[key figures](World_States.md "wikilink") of the major power that sends
them. Destroying key figures will bring about their own special "visit"
events in retaliation.

## Types of Outpost Visits/Assaults: Ally Reinforcements

Some allied factions have reinforcement events, which will trigger in
response to certain hostile events from mutual enemy factions. They will
attempt to reach your base before the incoming hostile event does,
though they may fail if their own territory is too far away. If more
than one allied reinforcement event is valid for a specific hostile
event, all valid allied reinforcements will be sent.

## Types of Outpost Visits/Assaults: Base Attacks

![](Base_Attack_Map.jpg "Base_Attack_Map.jpg") Base Attacks are not
technically part of the events system, but have similar interactions
with player bases. They are wandering squads that spawn in the
wilderness, and actively seek out and assault player owned bases if they
are nearby. Sometimes these can also be affected by [](World_States.md), generally the killing or capturing of
said faction's leader or leaders will stop these types of squads from
spawning, though rarely it is the status of other faction's characters.
There is a setting to change the frequency of these attacks in the
options menu.

The following factions have squads with this behavior:

- [Band of Bones](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md "wikilink")

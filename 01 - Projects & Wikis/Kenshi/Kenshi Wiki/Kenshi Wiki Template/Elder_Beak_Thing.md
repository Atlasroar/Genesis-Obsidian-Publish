**Elder Beak Things**are, due to their age, much larger, stronger, and
faster [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink"). They are fairly rare, and
only found in the [Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink") and [](High_Bonefields.md).

Caution is advised when approaching, as it is nearly impossible to
escape from one using speed alone. One should use their large size
against them and escape by baiting the Elder into attacking then running
behind objects to hide from sight. Their attack speed is faster,
allowing them to potentially hit a fleeing target more often than
younger Beak Things. Their running speed can outpace even a high-level
Athletics character with Masterwork [](Scout_Leg_(right).md), however due to their slow attack
animation they usually cannot hit said character.

Elder Beak Things' attack radius is bigger than what you might expect as
animals weapon reach is increased with age. It makes them capable of
hitting large groups of characters if they're too close to each other.
Combined with their age-boosted stats, this makes them a terrifyingly
powerful enemy.

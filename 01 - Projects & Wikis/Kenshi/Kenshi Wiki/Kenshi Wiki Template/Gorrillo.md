**Gorrillo** is the leader of [](The_Gorrillo_Bandits.md). He can be found in [](The_Old_Prison.md). Upon seeing a player character he
will exclaim his dislike of "tiny people" breaking in to his home trying
to hunt him down.

Not to be confused with the animal [Gorillo](Gorillo.md "wikilink"), where
he might get his name from. Certainly not to his face.

His bounty is 50,000 Cats and can be claimed in the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) and the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md). The closest place to collect his
bounty is [Catun](Catun.md "wikilink").

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If Gorrillo is killed, Gorrilo Bandits will cease to spawn in
[Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink") and [](Flats_Lagoon.md).

## Tips

- Gorrillo will sometimes personally kick out downed enemies from his
  Fortress. This can lead to an easy way to separate him from his fairly
  large gang. When he carries enemies out, you can just ambush him,
  retrieve your comrade and get the bounty.

## Trivia

- His name has 1 more 'r' than the animal [Gorillo](Gorillo.md "wikilink")
  (so spelling is important here).

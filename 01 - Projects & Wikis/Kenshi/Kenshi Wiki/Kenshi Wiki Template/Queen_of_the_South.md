**Queen of the South** is leader of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md) and has [](Diplomatic_Status.md). She sits upon her throne located
in [Southern Hive](Southern_Hive_(Location).md "wikilink") protected by her
[Elite Droneguards](Elite_Droneguard.md "wikilink") who will attack any
intruders. She rules over her subjects with the help of her consort, the
[King](King.md "wikilink").

Despite all other members of the Southern Hive having a distinct pink
coloration of their skin, the Queen of the South appears to be exactly
of the same colour as her rival, [the Queen](The_Queen.md "wikilink") of
the [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink").

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

**Queen of the South** is linked to several world states, most of which
require for her to be alive and for the **Queen of the Western Hive** to
be dead.

If Queen of the South is alive and not kidnapped and the Queen of the
Western Hive is dead then Southern Hive patrols will spawn in the
[Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink"), [](Border_Zone.md), [](Flats_Lagoon_(Zone).md), [](Okran's_Gulf.md), [](Okran's_Pride.md), [The Hook](The_Hook.md "wikilink"), [](The_Swamp.md) and in [Vain](Vain.md "wikilink").

If Queen of the South is alive and not kidnapped, the
[Savant](Savant.md "wikilink") is dead or kidnapped, then Southern Hive
patrols will spawn in [Sonorous Dark](Sonorous_Dark.md "wikilink") and the
[Skinhouses](Skinhouse.md "wikilink") will be under Hive control.

If Queen of the South is alive and not kidnapped, the
[Elder](Elder.md "wikilink") is dead or kidnapped, then Southern Hive
patrols will spawn in [Stobe's Garden](Stobe's_Garden.md "wikilink") and
[The Crags](The_Crags.md "wikilink"). [Iron HQ](Iron_HQ.md "wikilink") will
also be taken over by the Southern Hive.

If Queen of the South is alive and not kidnapped, the
[Valamon](Valamon.md "wikilink") is dead or kidnapped, then Southern Hive
will overtake the [Reaver Camps](Reaver_Camp.md "wikilink").

[Killing or kidnapping](World_States.md "wikilink") the Queen of the South
will cause all Southern Hive locations to become
[invaded](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") by [Fogmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") and
for the [Southern Hive Visit](Southern_Hive_Visit.md "wikilink") and [](Hive_Eviction.md) events to stop happening.

## Trivia

- **Queen of the South** has the exact same stats as her Western cousin,
  [The Queen](The_Queen.md "wikilink"). This may imply that the color of
  southern hivers is given by the biomass created by King from living
  creatures to generate new hives and that both queens were originally
  created in similar ways.
- Although she is a robot, the Queen of the South has a Hunger rate
  of 3. If you were to place her inside of a cage you own she would
  starve before too long.

Steady Arm (left) is a [Robot Limb](Robot_Limbs.md "wikilink"), and a
replacement for a lost left arm. This is the only robot limb that boosts
[Crossbows](Crossbows.md "wikilink"), so it is ideal for rangers.

Since there are only left-handed Steady Arms, and only right-handed
[Thief's Arms](Thief's_Arm_(right).md "wikilink"), these two arms synergize
well together. They both increase [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"), and
do not lower any [Statistics](Statistics.md "wikilink") that the other arm
raises.

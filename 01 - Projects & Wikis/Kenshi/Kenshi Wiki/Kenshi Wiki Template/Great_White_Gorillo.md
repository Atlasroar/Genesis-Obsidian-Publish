**Great White Gorillo** is an XL size unique version of the normal
[Gorillo](Gorillo.md "wikilink").  It has substantially increased Stats as
well as an increased Attack Rate.  It can be found in the locked lab
building located in the center of [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink") (It is
considered a crime to unlock this gate but is easily done without
detection).  It can spawn on any level and will generally attack only
when you enter the level it is on.

If a player manages to kill the Great White Gorillo and a player
character brings a [Great White Claw](Great_White_Claw.md "wikilink") into
the Bar, the barman will congratulate the player and give them some Grog
to celebrate.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) Their "weapon" provides them with 5.2 cut
damage and 13 blunt damage which is unaffected by stats. The Great White
Gorillo has 3 attacking animations, 2 of which have 100 power and one
which has only 70. To find the damage for the 70 power attack simply
multiply the results for the variants below by 0.7.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.05844149 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.02925) + Strength (0.08775)

<u>**Variant 2**</u>

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.06739199 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.039) + Strength (0.117)

<u>**Variant 3**</u>

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.07634249 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.04875) + Strength (0.14625)

**Ninja Guards** are generic characters which can spawn as a member of
either the [Trade Ninjas](Trade_Ninjas.md "wikilink") or [](Shinobi_Thieves.md) factions.

**Ninja Guards** are shop guards of the [](Trade_Ninjas.md). They can be seen guarding
[bars](Bar.md "wikilink") like the one in [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink").

**Ninja Guards**can be found within and occasionally outside Thief
watchtowers. They become allies who will defend you from being attacked
after joining the [Shinobi Thieves](Shinobi_Thieves.md "wikilink") by
talking to the [Thief Boss](Thief_Boss.md "wikilink").

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

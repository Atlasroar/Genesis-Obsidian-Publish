The **Bugmaster** is the leader of Spiders and a dangerous criminal who
resides in the [](Throne_of_the_Bugmaster.md), surrounded by a giant
army of [Skin Spiders](Skin_Spider.md "wikilink") and [](Blood_Spider.md).

It is highly recommended that players avoid encountering Bugmaster until
they have a group of high level [stats](Statistics.md "wikilink") and mid
to endgame gear. Alternatively, players with high
[Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink") and
[Assassination](Assassination.md "wikilink") skills player can attempt to
sneak into his tower to knock him out, although the knockout will likely
have a low chance of success due to his high toughness.

He has a Maniacal [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

The Bugmaster is currently preparing himself to fight an enemy in the
[Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink"). This is evident by a
[map](Maps.md "wikilink") which he is in possession of.

## Claiming Bounty

If the Bugmaster is defeated by the Player and/or their party, they can
bring the c.100,000 bounty to the HQ of the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md), in [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink").
Carrying the Bugmaster in proximity of Shek Warriors or civilians will
prompt them to tell you to bring Him to the [](Stone_Golem.md), the faction leader. The Stone Golem is
located in [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink").

Turning him in will also give you +100 Reputation with the Shek Kingdom.
You will gain +70 Rep by turning him in to the [](Stone_Golem.md) aid, and the rest for talking to her
directly after (if the player wants to acquire
**[Seto](Seto.md "wikilink")** in their party then talking to the Stone
Golem should be slightly delayed to allow Seto to join the party).

An alliance with the [United Cities](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink")/[](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md)/[](Traders_Guild.md) prior to turning in the Bugmaster to
[Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink") the [Stone Golem's](Stone_Golem.md "wikilink")
aid will remove the Reputation gain entirely with the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) and you will not be able to talk with
Esata the Stone Golem at all. This removes the possibility of a unique
recruit, her daughter [Seto](Seto.md "wikilink"). On the plus side, you
will also not have a -10 reputation with HN for turning in Bugmaster to
SK in this case.

**WARNING: By turning in the Bugmaster to the Shek Kingdom, you will
first gain a -10 rep with HN for turning in Bugmaster, and then a -70
rep with The Holy Nation if accepting alliance after, effectively making
them hostile unless your initial reputation with HN is already 51, which
is not possible to be the case as it makes HN your ally and will trigger
the above case instead.**

The Bugmaster can also be turned in to the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), however there is no extra benefits
besides the reward money and a very small (+2) reputation boost. On the
plus side, there aren't any penalties of reputation from HN either.

## [World states](World_States.md "wikilink")

Defeating the Bugmaster prompts Berserkers to attack the player's
outpost, in a '[](Challenger_of_the_Undefeated.md)' event consisting
of at least 2 squads of Berserkers.

The [Band of Bones](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md "wikilink") will be so impressed by
the [player](Nameless.md "wikilink") that they no longer
[Raid](Raid.md "wikilink") [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md).

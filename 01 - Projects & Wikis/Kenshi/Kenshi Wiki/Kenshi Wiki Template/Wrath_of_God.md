The **Wrath of God** is a [Holy Nation](Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") event
that is launched once a player takes down [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md). It technically has a max range
of 90,000 meters, and a "near" range of 50,000 meters, but both are far
larger than the map itself, meaning that the initial event has a 100% of
triggering each day no matter where in Kenshi's map you live.

Normally the event will be led by [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), and he is required for the
initial event to trigger (Note: There is a variant that is meant to have
[High Inquisitor Valtena](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md "wikilink"), which is
supposed to trigger after [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) has been killed or captured, but
in vanilla this is bugged and will not trigger due to [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) being set as the leader).
Subsequent triggers of the event by defeating it do not require [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) to have survived,
though the assaults will cease unless you've defeated [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) before triggering the event
(due to the aforementioned bug with his variants not triggering).

This event has three main variants, with the second triggering after
defeating the first, and the third triggering after defeating the
second, with the third having a high chance to repeat after each defeat.

- The first variant, the initial one, will be led by [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), followed by 5
  [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink") and 3
  [Inquisitors](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"). He will also be accompanied by
  3-5 squads each consisting of 1 [Inquisitor](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"),
  1-2 [High Paladins](High_Paladin.md "wikilink"), 10-12
  [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), and 4-9 [](Holy_Servant.md). If defeated, the second variant
  will trigger in 30-60 hours, assuming [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) is still okay, or both he and
  [High Inquisitor Valtena](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md "wikilink") have
  been killed or captured.
- The second variant will be led by either [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), or one of the normal
  [Inquisitors](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"). Seta will bring his entourage of
  5 [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink") and 3
  [Inqusitors](Inquisitor.md "wikilink") if he joins the assault.
  Otherwise, the assault forces will consist of 3-4 squads each
  consisting of 1 [Inquisitor](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"), 1-2 [](High_Paladin.md), 10-12
  [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), and 4-9 [](Holy_Servant.md). If defeated, it has a 95% of
  triggering the third variant in 36-80 hours. If [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) has been killed or captured,
  but [High Inquisitor Valtena](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md "wikilink") has
  not, the third variant will trigger, but will fail when the timer
  reaches 0.
- The third and final variant will be led by either [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), or one of the normal
  [Inquisitors](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"). Seta will bring his entourage of
  5 [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink") and 3
  [Inqusitors](Inquisitor.md "wikilink") if he joins the assault.
  Otherwise, the assault forces will consist of 3-5 squads each
  consisting of 1 [Inquisitor](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"), 1-2 [](High_Paladin.md), 10-12
  [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), and 4-9 [](Holy_Servant.md). If defeated, and as long as [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) has not been killed
  or captured, it will have a 100% chance of repeating the third event
  again in 168-672 hours. If [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) has been killed or captured,
  but [High Inquisitor Valtena](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md "wikilink") has
  not, the event will trigger again, but will fail when the timer
  reaches 0. If both have been killed or captured, there is a 95% chance
  of repeating in 168-672 hours.

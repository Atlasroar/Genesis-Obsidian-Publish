**Wells** is [Industry Tech](Industry_Tech.md "wikilink") which allows the
player to construct [Well](Well.md "wikilink") buildings. This technology
leads to [Rain Collector](Rain_Collector_(Tech).md "wikilink"), technology
which unlocks another building that generates [Water](Water.md "wikilink")
items.

Players who have [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md) in a
[Zone](:Category:Zones "wikilink") which does not have rain should
complete this research. Players who make use of
[Hydroponics](Hydroponics.md "wikilink") should also research wells.

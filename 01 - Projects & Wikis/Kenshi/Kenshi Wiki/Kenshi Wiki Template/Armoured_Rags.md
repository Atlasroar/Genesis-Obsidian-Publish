![](Caravan_Drone.png "Caravan_Drone.png") with an [](Armoured_Rag_Skirt.md) and **Armoured Rags**.\]\]
**Armoured Rags** is a Medium Armour equipped in the Body Armour slot.
By default, the rags are beige in color. However, a separate armor of
the same name but with an added '(colored)' exists. Together with
[Armoured Rag Skirt](Armoured_Rag_Skirt.md "wikilink") it forms a set that
can also be [dyed](Colour_Scheme.md "wikilink") different colours depending
on the character it is equipped on first.

This armour's low stomach coverage can be a less significant issue for
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") and especially [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink")
characters, since they are significantly less likely to be hit in the
stomach when compared to other races.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **4x6**.

## Appearance

The **Armoured Rags** appears like a thick shawl with a wide, turtleneck
collar. Long, thick sleeves appear to be connected underneath this shawl
and reach all the way to the wrists. A pair of long, metal vambraces are
wrapped over the sleeves to cover the forearms. Two metal plates protect
the chest, attached to the ensemble by criss-crossing leather straps.

## Crafting


Note that although the blueprint exists, it is unneeded as the research
to unlock the Smithy also unlocks the Rags.

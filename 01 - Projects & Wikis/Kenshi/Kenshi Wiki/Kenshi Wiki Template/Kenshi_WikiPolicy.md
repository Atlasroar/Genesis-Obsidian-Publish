There are very few **policies** which apply across all Wikia. These can
be found on the Central Wikia at
[Wikia:Category:Policy](Wikia:Category:Policy "wikilink").

Other policies for this Wikia should be decided by the wiki community.
It's generally best to keep policies as simple as possible, and not to
introduce too many rules. A growing wiki can usually do well with a few
simple policies and a lot of goodwill and cooperation.

Adding `[[Category:Policy|Category:Policy]]` to any policy pages will
add them to the policy category. This is found
[here](:Category:Policy "wikilink").

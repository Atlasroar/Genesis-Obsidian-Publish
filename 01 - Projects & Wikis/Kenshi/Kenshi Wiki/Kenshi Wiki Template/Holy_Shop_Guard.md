**Holy Shop Guards** are guards of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). They can normally be found inside
shops in Holy Nation towns.

They are slightly weaker than the normal [](Shop_Guard.md) and wield inferior blunt weapons, they
also appear to have better jack of all trades skills on Laboring,
Farming and Cooking than the standard Shop Guard. They have a set gender
and race as well as holy nation-related dialogue lines to further set
them apart. Although unique to holy nation, they can also spawn
alongside with the standard **Shop Guard**.

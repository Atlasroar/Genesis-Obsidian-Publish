**Miu** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink"). She is found
in the town of [Shark](Shark:_Swamp_Town "wikilink") in [](The_Swamp.md). She has a Brave
[Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

She claims to be an ex-slave, who escaped with a friend called Ned, only
to watch him getting killed by a spider right at the town's gates. She
has good [Labouring](Labouring.md "wikilink") skills and is an excellent
farmer, but her other stats are lacking. She will ask to join the player
without a cost.

Miu is a useful recruit for any party as she would react to the presence
of any spiders in an area with her unique dialogue lines, making her a
real-time spider radar. Another unique recruit with a similar ability is
[Pia](Pia.md "wikilink").

## Dialogue

When Miu is travelling with [Hamut](Hamut.md "wikilink"), he might say:

Hamut: This scent... it reminds me of her...

Miu: I'm sorry about your wife, Hamut. Slavers, they're the scum of the
earth.

Hamut: And I'm sorry about your time in the mines... I won't let them
take you again

Miu: We'll take them down one day, Hamut. You and me, together.

The Swamp:

Miu is traumatized by her friend's death to the swamp spiders, and she
will freak out with multiple lines of dialogue if any get close or aggro
to the squad. This can actually provide a useful early warning system as
her dialogue will often trigger before the spiders are visible on the
player's screen.

## Trivia

- There used to be a bug which would cause Miu to spawn as a male
  sometimes.

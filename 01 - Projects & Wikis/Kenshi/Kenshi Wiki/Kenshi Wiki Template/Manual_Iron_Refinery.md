**Manual Iron Refinery** is an [](Industry_Buildings.md) where players can convert [](Raw_Iron.md) into [Iron Plates](Iron_Plates.md "wikilink").
This is the first of many buildings which can perform this task. It
requires one to three workers to operate. Players can construct this
building after researching [Iron Plates](Iron_Plates_(Tech).md "wikilink").

The **Manual Iron Refinery** cannot be upgraded into the [](Iron_Refinery.md) for some reason. This building is
still desirable, as it does not require electricity to operate.

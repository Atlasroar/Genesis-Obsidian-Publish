**King**Â is a unique [Crimper](Crimper.md "wikilink") and a leader of the
[Southern Hive](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink"). He can be found wandering the
[Royal Valley](Royal_Valley.md "wikilink") alongside his
[Droneguards](Droneguard.md "wikilink"). If imprisoned by the Southern
Hive, King will appear and begin to eat the character.

If the player has kidnapped the Queen, King will join a [](Base_Assault.md) against the player. This base assault
squad also contains a [Prince](Prince.md "wikilink"), a [](War_Gorillo.md), and 8
[Droneguards](Droneguard.md "wikilink").

Behind the Queen base are prisoner poles. If the player does not want to
search for King, place a companion as a prisoner and King will come to
feed on the prisoner.

## Stats

When spawned at the [](Southern_Hive_(Location).md), King will spawn with an age
multiplier of 2.30x to 2.50x, bringing his skills well over 100. He is
very powerful, and one of the strongest melee combatants in the game.
However, when spawned as part of the raid that attempts to rescue the
[Queen of the South](Queen_of_the_South.md "wikilink"), he will only spawn
with a multiplier of 0.80x to 1.00x, making him much weaker in that
scenario. Although he is supposed to have an [](AI%20Core.md), it does not spawn due to his small inventory
size.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) Their "weapon" provides them with 5.2 cut
damage and 13 blunt damage which is unaffected by stats. King has 3
attacking animations, 2 of which have 100 power and one which has only
70. To find the damage for the 70 power attack simply multiply the
results for the variants below by 0.7.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.05844149 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.02925) + Strength (0.08775)

<u>**Variant 2**</u>

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.06739199 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.039) + Strength (0.117)

<u>**Variant 3**</u>

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.07634249 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.04875) + Strength (0.14625)

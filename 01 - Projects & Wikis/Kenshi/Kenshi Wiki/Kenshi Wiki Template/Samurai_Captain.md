**Samurai Captains** are elite officers in the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) armies. They can be found leading
groups of [Samurai Heavies](Samurai_Heavy.md "wikilink") in patrolling
towns or serving as barracks' leaders. They can also be found guarding
important figures such as [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") and [](Emperor_Tengu.md), alongside squads of [](Samurai_Elite.md) and [](Jonin_Elite.md). One Samurai Captain accompanies
[Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink") into battle.

There are in total 8 Samurai Captains guarding **Emperor Tengu** under
default [Heft](Heft.md "wikilink"). If **Heft** is malnourished, there will
be only 6 of them.

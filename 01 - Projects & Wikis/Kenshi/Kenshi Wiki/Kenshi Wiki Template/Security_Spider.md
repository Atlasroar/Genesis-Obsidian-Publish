**Security Spider** is a [Robot](Robots.md "wikilink") similar to the [](Iron_Spider.md), but stronger. They are found in
[Ancient Locations](Ancient_Locations.md "wikilink") such as [](Ancient_Labs.md) and [](Lost_Armoury.md).

Their strength stat is fairly high, causing most characters to stumble
and allowing them to penetrate most blocks. Being robotic, they are
incapable of eating and will thus not eat your character upon KO.
However, they usually don't leave the area as they typically spawn in
fairly small, enclosed spaces, so be careful about getting back up if
you regain consciousness. On top of all of this, they tend to gang up on
the player, so fighting in a group against these can be a valuable
strategy, if only to distract the spiders so they don't all prioritize
one person.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which Security
Spiders have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

**United Cities Route** is a [](World_State_Routes.md) where the player has allied
relationship with [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") and having
initiated dialogue with [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink") or
[Koin](Koin.md "wikilink") that opens up the questline for UC.

The player can decide to speak with **Emperor Tengu** about quest
matters, however, it will be usually directed to **Koin** instead, who
will tell you which targets should and shouldn't be taken down.

Notably, the 3 main objectives that the UC targets are [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md), [](Boss_Simion.md) and [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink").

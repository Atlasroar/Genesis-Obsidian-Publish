Much like the [Manhunters](Manhunters.md "wikilink") faction, **Slave
Hunters**are people looking to profit by recapturing and selling escaped
[Slaves](Slavery.md "wikilink"), albeit weaker and less-equipped. They can
often be found in areas which escaped slaves frequent. Players should be
wary near them, as they will occasionally attack innocents in order to
make a quick buck selling them into slavery.

Like Slave Traders, Slave Hunters will pick up any unconscious
characters and haul them to a slave location.

**Old Village** is a ruined town owned by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md) in the eastern side of [](The_Great_Desert.md). This location consists of a couple
ravaged Old [Storm Houses](Storm_House.md "wikilink"), one ruin of a Storm
House, three [Small Shack](Small_Shack.md "wikilink") ruins, two working
[wells](Well.md "wikilink"), a [water tank](Water_Tank.md "wikilink") and six
[cactus farms](Cactus_Farm.md "wikilink"), all beautifully placed between
two wave-like dunes.

Inside of the preserved buildings some low level loot can be found
([Fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink"), [Armour Plating](Armour_Plating.md "wikilink"),
[Iron Plates](Iron_Plates.md "wikilink"), [](Steel_Bars.md), [](Building_Materials.md),
[Electronics](Electrical_Components.md "wikilink"),
[Fabrics](Fabrics.md "wikilink"), [Water Jugs](Water_Jug.md "wikilink"),
[Cups](Cup.md "wikilink"), [Wooden Bowls](Wooden_Bowl.md "wikilink"),
[Gears](Gears.md "wikilink"), [Lantern](Lantern.md "wikilink"), [](Advanced_Splint_Kit.md), [](Authentic_Skeleton_Repair_Kit.md), and [](Sleeping_Bag.md)). Each house has at least one usable
sitting box among the general furniture remains. The Old Village can be
a good hiding location for a group hoping to wait out [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) patrols or
[Manhunter](Manhunters.md "wikilink") squads, especially considering travel
and medical loot that could be found here.

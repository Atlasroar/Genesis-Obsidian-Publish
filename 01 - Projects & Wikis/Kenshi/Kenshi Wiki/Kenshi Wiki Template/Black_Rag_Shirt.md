![](ShinobiGuard2.png "ShinobiGuard2.png") wearing a **Black Rag
Shirt**\]\] The **Black Rag Shirt** is a piece of Clothing that is
equipped in the Body Armour slot. Because of its color, it has a stealth
bonus unlike its [plain](Rag_Shirt.md "wikilink"),
[dyed](Dyed_Rag_Shirt.md "wikilink"), and
[holy](Holy_Servant_Rags.md "wikilink") variants.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **4x6**.

## Appearance

The **Black Rag Shirt** is made up of several ragged strips of black
cloth that wrap around the characters neck and upper torso. Some strips
of this wrap hang down and cover a small amount of the stomach. Both
hands are wrapped in a similar fashion but additional strips cover the
left forearm.

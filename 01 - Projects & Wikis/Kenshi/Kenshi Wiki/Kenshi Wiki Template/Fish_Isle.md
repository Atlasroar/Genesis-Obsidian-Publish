**Fish Isle** is a [Major Town](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") in [](Fishman_Island.md). Like the rest of the island, it is
inhabited by [Fishmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink").

It is completely in ruins, but prior to being overrun it contained
several [](Medium_Building_Shells_(Tech).md). The fact that part
of the town is surrounded by walls suggests that it was a smaller
outpost that was finally found to be worth investing into. It was
probably expanding rapidly before being abandoned quite abruptly.

This location spawns a lot of low level loot. [ru:Рыбный

**Empire Weapon Shops** are [weapon shops](Weapons_Shops.md "wikilink")
owned by the [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink") found in [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md).

This shop is the larger version of [](Small_Empire_Weapon_Shop.md), and therefore also contains
a larger variety and quantities than it's counterpart.

**Red Sabre Boss** is the boss of the [](Red_Sabres.md). He resides in [](Red_Sabre_Hideout.md) surrounded by 22 [](Red_Sabre.md). Though he is named in his bounty letter,
he is not given the name 'The Red Bandit' in-game.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached to their faction. The colour
is also separately attached to this character, although it is the same
colour as the faction's colour.

He has a bounty of c.10,000 in the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) and the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

The **Red Sabre Boss's**capture or death will result in the roaming [](Red_Sabre.md) patrols in [](The_Swamp.md) to be weakened, going from 7-11 men to 2-6
men per squad. If [Shade](Shade.md "wikilink") is alive, the Boss's capture
or death will also cause the roaming [](Swamp_Ninjas.md) patrols to increase in strength, going
from a [Swamp Ninja Chunin](Swamp_Ninja_Chunin.md "wikilink") and 5-10
[Swamp Ninja Genins](Swamp_Ninja_Genin.md "wikilink") per squad to 5-7
Chunins, 4-6 Genins, and a possible [](Swamp_Ninja_Jonin.md). It will also stop the [](Red_Sabre_Raid.md) from triggering.

**Shek Scouts** are warriors of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md). They can be found roaming the [](Stenn_Desert.md) and [](Spider_Plains.md) in small groups of 4 to 7. They are
equipped similarly to the [Shek Warriors](Shek_Warrior.md "wikilink") but
are slightly stronger. True to their name, they are only found wandering
outside Shek towns.

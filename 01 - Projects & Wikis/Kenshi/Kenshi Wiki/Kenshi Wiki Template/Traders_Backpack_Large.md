The **Large Trader's Backpack** is a heavy
weight [backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") that is able to stack [](Trade_Goods.md) by at least two items per spot. It
multiplies the maximum stack for any stackable item by 3 leading to
stack sizes of 6.

Can be found equipped (not sold) by traders at the [](Holy_Armour_Shop.md), Clothing Shop - Holy Nation, [](Holy_Headgear_Shop.md), [](Holy_Boot_Shop.md), and [](Boot_Shop.md). 

They cannot be bought, so to obtain one they must be taken from a
Shopkeepers. As it looks similar to the other Traders Backpack in game
an easy way to tell if a Shopkeeper is wearing a Traders Backpack Large
and not a Shopkeepers good bag is to check their movement speed. If they
are not slowed down a ton by encumbrance, then they have a Traders
Backpack Large.

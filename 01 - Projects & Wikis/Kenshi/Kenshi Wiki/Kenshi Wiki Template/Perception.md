**Perception** is the [Statistic](Statistics.md "wikilink") that determines
how well a character will perceive things in their environment.

Perception governs the characters accuracy with ranged weapons. It's
especially important for hitting far away or moving targets.

Perception is reduced by up to -20% during [](Weather_Effects.md#Duststorms), depending on the
severity of the storm.

There are a few [Headgear](Headgear.md "wikilink") items which boost a
character's Perception stat.

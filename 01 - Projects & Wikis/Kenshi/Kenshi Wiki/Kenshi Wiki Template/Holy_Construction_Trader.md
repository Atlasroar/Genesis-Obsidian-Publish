**Holy Construction Traders** are unnamed shopkeepers of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). They can be found in [](Holy_Mechanical_Shop.md).

Like their [Ronin counterparts](Ronin_Construction_Trader.md "wikilink")
they sell the player various construction goods and crops to kickstart
research. Unlike the Ronins however, they are much more subdued in
answering questions related to [](Ancient_Science_Book.md), as the items in question are
illegal within Holy Nation territory.

As [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") get constantly damaged and
repaired, their bodies start to wear down. When this wear becomes too
much, it can be repaired at a**Skeleton Repair Bed**.

This wear also occurs on skeleton limbs worn by non-skeleton characters
and can be repaired by a repair bed. These beds can also patch up
organic body parts in the same way bandages do but does not multiply the
rate at which they heal. Robotic body parts heal 8x faster, and
blood/oil twice as fast when resting in a Skeleton Repair Bed.

But this can be risky as sometime a character may get back up from a bed (leg health goes below KO point, then heals past it) on their own. |

**Humans**are the most populous race in the world of
[Kenshi](Kenshi.md "wikilink"). Human is also a [race](Races.md "wikilink")
category which includes [Greenlanders](Greenlander.md "wikilink") and
[Scorchlanders](Scorchlander.md "wikilink").

## Greenlanders

[Greenlanders](Greenlander.md "wikilink") are the most similar to humans on
Earth. They serve as a reference point for hunger and are generally
well-rounded in terms of stats, since they do not have any innate racial
skill penalties, and their bonuses only apply to
[Farming](Farming.md "wikilink"), [Cooking](Cooking.md "wikilink"), and
[Science](Science.md "wikilink").

## Scorchlanders

[Scorchlanders](Scorchlander.md "wikilink") are anatomically similar to
Greenlanders but are differentiated by their much darker skin color,
glowing eyes, and silvery hair. They are more specialized compared to
Greenlanders, as they have innate racial bonuses in [](Armour_Smith.md), [](Weapon_Smith.md), [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"),
[Dodge](Dodge.md "wikilink"), [stealth,](Stealth.md "wikilink") and
[Athletics](Athletics.md "wikilink"). Compared to a Greenlander they also
run faster (Until they reach 100 Athletics at which point they move at
the same speed), heal 10% faster and bleed 10% less. The tradeoff is a
slight reduction in [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") experience gain.

## History

According to theories that can be drawn from clues and text in the world
of Kenshi, humanity dates much farther back than the modern age, being
alive during a much more technologically advanced [](History_of_Kenshi.md). Whether or not humanity predates
skeletons is unclear, and this is only one of the mysteries that
complicates the history between skeletons and humans. Humanity has been
able to endure a number of natural disasters and conflicts that has
plagued the world of Kenshi, but many of the humans you meet within
Kenshi are apparently unfamiliar with their own history.

## Stats

## Strategy

The best means of attack would be to man harpoons in front of your
outposts main gate while having other characters repair the gate during
conflict, unfortunately raiders may group too tightly in front of your
gate and be forced through the gate so having trained soldiers behind
your gate is also advised.

**Catun** is a [Major Town](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") controlled by the
[United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"). It is located on a plateau in
the middle of a valley in the [Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink"). It
can be found by exploration or by acquiring and reading the
**[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the United Cities (Extended Territories)**.

[Lord Shiro](Lord_Shiro.md "wikilink") is the residing member of the [](Noble_Circle.md) for Catun. The town resembles a
medieval fortress with a large number of Outpost s-IIIs acting as wall
towers. It is home to the [](Catun_Scrapmasters.md), most sophisticated weapon
smiths living in the world of Kenshi
([self-described](Catun_Scrapmaster_(Character).md "wikilink")). Catun is
subject to a change under the [world states](World_States.md "wikilink").

Catun is a well-defended settlement. United Cities samurai, armed with
polearms, frequently engage trespassing [](Skin_Spider.md), [](Boneyard_Wolf.md), [garrus](Garru.md "wikilink") and [](Beak_Thing.md). Humanoid troublemakers are only
represented by one or two occasional [](Band_of_Bones_(Character).md) characters. None stand a
chance against the skill and numbers of the UC samurai in this town.

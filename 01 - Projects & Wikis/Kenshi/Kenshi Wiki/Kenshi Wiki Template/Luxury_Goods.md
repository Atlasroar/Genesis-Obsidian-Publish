**Luxury Goods** are a Trade Good that can be bought and sold to make a
profit. They are sold by [](Trade_Goods_Trader.md) at the 'Trade' building in
towns.

These are commonly found in [Noble Houses](Noble_House.md "wikilink"),
where they can be stolen to earn a minor profit if strapped for cash.
They look like a casket (with expensive items probably inside).

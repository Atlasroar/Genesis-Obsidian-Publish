While also used for trade, the main function of **Building Materials**is
the [Construction](Construction.md "wikilink") of buildings and objects,
such as outposts or interior items.

Building Materials can be purchased from Construction Traders in towns
or produced on your own at a [](Stone_Processor.md) from [](Raw_Stone.md). A [](Hybrid_Stone_Mine.md), a late-game building, can create
Building Materials directly without the need to process them.

They can be stored in [Storage: Building
Materials](Storage:_Building_Materials "wikilink").

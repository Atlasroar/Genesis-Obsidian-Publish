**Agnu** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink"). They can be
found imprisoned by the [Thrall Masters](Thrall_Masters.md "wikilink") in
the top floor of the [Tower of Abuse](Tower_of_Abuse.md "wikilink"). Agnu
will join the player after being freed. They are the only
[Soldierbot](Soldierbot.md "wikilink") that can be recruited without the
use of [mods](Modifications.md "wikilink"). Soldierbots heal 50% faster
than normal Skeletons and can see from MUCH further away.

Agnu has several lines of unique dialogue, most of which are screams
because, similar to [Ray](Ray.md "wikilink"), Agnu is unable to speak,
although unlike Ray is still capable of making unintelligible noises.
Agnu often shares these dialogues with
[Beep](Beep.md "wikilink").![](AgnuFree.jpg "AgnuFree.jpg")

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

Agnu has a set clothing color (blue robot rags). This will allow them to
[dye colourable clothing](Colour_Scheme.md "wikilink") such as the
[Armoured Rags (colored)](Armoured_Rags_(colored).md "wikilink") and
[Armoured Rag Skirt (colored)](Armoured_Rag_Skirt_(colored).md "wikilink")
which are conveniently worn by their captors.

Agnu is perhaps related to the [Second Empire](Second_Empire.md "wikilink")
police forces found at [Police Barracks](Police_Barracks.md "wikilink"),
because they share the same clothing color and race.

A bug existed in some [game versions](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Changelog.md "wikilink") prior to the
1.0 release that prevented unique prisoners like Agnu and
[Cat](Cat.md "wikilink") to spawn if the game was imported in the past.
Importing again without "Dead NPCs" fixed the problem.

## Trivia

- Agnu was [named after Chris Hunt's (creator of Kenshi)
  motorcycle](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenshi/comments/aww8ff/this_is_the_cutest_thing_ive_ever_seen_character/ehrp9fl/),
  which was in turn named after the [Headless body of
  Agnew](https://theinfosphere.org/Headless_body_of_Agnew) from
  Futurama - due to its "similar personality of loud growling and being
  impossible to control".
- If you try to go through [Venge](Venge.md "wikilink") while having other
  characters in your squad, Agnu may stop and scream. He won't move even
  if you set him to move manually. If [Beep](Beep.md "wikilink") is nearby,
  he may calm Agnu down and return him to normal.

## Tips

- You can rush to the Tower of Abuse on day one with a pair of
  tools/hacksaws (Or two if you care about your starting character) to
  free Agnu. To escape simply make use of the r trick. (Hold movement
  key and periodically click r to halt enemy advances. If this fails to
  work save and load your game to cause enemies to behave normally as
  recruiting a character can cause some weird AI behavior.)

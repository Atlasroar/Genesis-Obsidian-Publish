**Advanced Splint Kits** are [medical](Medical_Items.md "wikilink")
[items](items.md "wikilink") used to improve functionality of injured
limbs. Once applied, they help limping characters run normally, except
in most extreme cases of limb damage. Players can learn how to craft
this item by researching [](Advanced_Splints_(Tech).md). After researching, these
kits can be crafted on a [](Medical_Workbench.md) or procured from the NPCs that
carry them for personal use - [](Wandering_Assassin.md), [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), [Doctors](Doctor.md "wikilink") and
[Surgeons](Surgeon.md "wikilink").

Important to note that without mods to fix NPC behavior they will never
actually use their Splint Kits.

The Advanced Splint Kit will rig a limb for health equal to your field
medic skill, up to a maximum of 51, and cannot exceed past 50 health.
(So you may rig a limb that is at -1 to 50, but cannot rig a limb from 0
to 51)

**Samurai Scouts** are one of the minor military soldiers of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md). They can be found on patrols in
various regions, following a [](Samurai_Sergeant.md).

They are notable for wearing a hat as their headgear and a chance to
spawn with a [Wakizashi](Wakizashi.md "wikilink") instead of
[Katana](Katana.md "wikilink") and also wears a light-set of [](Wooden_Sandals.md) and [](Samurai_Clothpants.md) instead of heavy-set of
[Samurai Boots](Samurai_Boots.md "wikilink") and [](Samurai_Legplates.md) worn by usual
[Samurai's](Samurai.md "wikilink"), respectively. Hence the name of being a
'Samurai Scout'.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md)

## Â Interactions

Patrols of Samurai have a chance of talking to the player, where they
will remark on the player being short on bodyguards. They will then
offer to escort the player, and if accepted will bodyguard the player
for 2 hours.

Patrols of Samurai may talk to the player while they are starving. If
they do they have a chance of taking pity on the character and giving
them 1 [Bread](Bread.md "wikilink"), 1 [Meatwrap](Meatwrap.md "wikilink"), and
1 [Greenfruit](Greenfruit.md "wikilink"). They may also instead attempt to
arrest the player unless manages to bribe them with 2000 cats. Once
convinced, they may offer the player a piece of
[Bread](Bread.md "wikilink") to last them until the nearest town.

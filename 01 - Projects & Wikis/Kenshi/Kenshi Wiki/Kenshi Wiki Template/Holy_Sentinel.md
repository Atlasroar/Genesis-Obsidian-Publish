**Holy Sentinels** are guards and middle-ranking foot soldiers for [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), charged with protecting towns
and assets such as mines. Sometimes they patrol, usually led by a
[Paladin](Paladin.md "wikilink").

They frequently stand at the gates of Holy Nation towns, checking
outsiders for contraband. They are also responsible for executing
heretics via burning in the lore.

Holy Sentinels are distinguished from Paladins in that they use [](Combat_Cleaver.md) instead of a [](Paladin's_Cross.md), and have slightly weaker stats. In
terms of appearance, Sentinels have reddish armor with a white emblem,
while Paladins have more grayish armor with a yellow emblem.

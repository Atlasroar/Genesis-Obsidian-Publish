The **Polearm**is an excellent weapon for killing animals. Its long
reach allow you to hit them from further away, and its damage bonus
against them makes sure every hit counts. Due to this, both
[Western](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") and
[Southern](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink") Hive soldiers use this as their
primary weapon.

This weapon has inventory dimensions of **1x10**, meaning it can only be
equipped as a primary weapon.

A [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") version of this weapon can be found on
[Queen of the South](Queen_of_the_South.md "wikilink") in [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md).

**Ancient Science Books** are needed for researching various
[Technologies](Technology.md "wikilink"). They are a fairly common item
spawned using the [Artifacts](Artifacts.md "wikilink") system.

This item is illegal in [The Holy Nation](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")
faction, and thus caution is advised before entering their towns with
one.

The technologies written about in these books are the base which formed
the foundation of the [Second Empire](Second_Empire.md "wikilink"), a
flourishing empire of archaeology and science dedicated to unearthing
the remnants of the First Empire. Now, many centuries after their fall,
the [Machinists](Machinists.md "wikilink") study these books and the
remnants of both empires.

## Where to obtain

Ancient Science Books are spread out over the world. Several shops in
the world do sell them, but very few. Shops that have a chance of
selling them are [Scraphouse](Scraphouse.md "wikilink") and [](Travel_and_Repairs_Shop.md).

As the name tells you, they are ancient and the few books that are
available to buy have probably been found by some brave adventurer. To
find a larger quantity, you yourself have to go out and seek them out.

Locations they can be found:

- [Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink")
- [Lost Libraries](Lost_Library.md "wikilink")
- [Lost Town](Lost_Town.md "wikilink")
- [Ancient Tech Labs](Ancient_Tech_Lab.md "wikilink")

And several other locations. Problem is that these locations are often
heavily guarded by hostile enemies.

You need a total of 154 Ancient Science Book to research everything.

## Tips

There are a few ruins which don't have any strong hostile enemies as
guards and can provide new players or weaker group some books early in
the game:

- [Workshop Complex](Workshop_Complex.md "wikilink") in [](The_Grid.md) is unguarded by any hostiles, but due to
  close proximity to [The Crater](The_Crater.md "wikilink"), small stray
  bands of [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") (2-3) can be found
  patrolling the complex sometimes. Requires a skilled
  [lockpicker](Lockpicking.md "wikilink") or a few sets of
  [Tools](Tools.md "wikilink").
- [Leaning Tower](Leaning_Tower.md "wikilink") in the
  [Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink") is unguarded, but only has a few
  books.

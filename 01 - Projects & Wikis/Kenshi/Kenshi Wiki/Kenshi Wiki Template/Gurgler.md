**Gurglers**are the most common of the [Fishmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink").
They can be found roaming in large packs on [](Fishman_Island.md) which is located south of the
[Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink").

Though they lack any threatening skills they focus on their population
size to overwhelm foes. Like their stronger
[cousins](Alpha_Gurgler.md "wikilink") they use their Claws to fight in
combat using [Martial Arts](Martial_Arts.md "wikilink").

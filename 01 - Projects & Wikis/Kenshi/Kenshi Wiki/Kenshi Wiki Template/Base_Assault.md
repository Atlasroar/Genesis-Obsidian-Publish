**Base Assaults** are a scrapped system that has since been replaced.
You can find the new version on the [Events](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Events.md "wikilink") page.

Base Assaults were an attack on the player's outpost where an army of a
[Faction](Faction.md "wikilink") raids the player's outpost to either
attack the inhabitants or steal resources and items. It was introduced
in [version 0.60.0](Update:0.60 "wikilink").

If there are no player characters in a base during an assault, then the
invading group will wait outside until someone returns before attacking.

## Causes of base assault

Base assaults occur when players are hostile with a faction or, if the
player is being extorted out of their [Cats](Cats.md "wikilink") via
racketeering or taxing, base assault can happen if the player refuses to
pay the faction. Sometimes base assaults can just be random.

Once the faction enters the outpost with their army, the player has a
few minutes to interact with them, which gives them a few options to
coerce them to cease the base assault, such as bribing them by giving up
all the funds or half of them, if persuaded. If the player doesn't
interact the invading army for awhile, they will automatically attack
and raid the player's outpost of their items and resources. If there are
any of the player's squad members, the army will attack them first
before looting the outpost.

Attacking the invading army after bribing them with valuables will *not*
recover them.

Major factions (The Holy Nation, United Cities, and Shek Kingdom) will
assault your base when relations become negative enough or if your
actions trigger one.

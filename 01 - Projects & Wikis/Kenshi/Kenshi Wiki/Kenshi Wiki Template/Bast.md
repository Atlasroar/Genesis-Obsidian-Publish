**Bast** was once a city within the United Cities, now it is only ruins.
Bast was recently destroyed by the Holy Nation. The only residents in
Bast are UC affiliated squatters living in the ruins. There are two
intact houses, one occupied by the squatters and the other one
abandoned. The only loot in Bast is junk and common materials with some
chance of [Backpacks](Backpacks.md "wikilink") or [](Camp_Bed.md) in the intact houses.

Bast is the starting location for the [](Game_Starts.md#Guy_with_a_Dog) game start. It can otherwise
be discovered by exploration or by acquiring and reading the
**[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the United Cities (Central Territories)**.

## Tips

The [Prisoner Cages](Prisoner_Cage.md "wikilink") around the city inside
can be a good way to train [Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink") skill.

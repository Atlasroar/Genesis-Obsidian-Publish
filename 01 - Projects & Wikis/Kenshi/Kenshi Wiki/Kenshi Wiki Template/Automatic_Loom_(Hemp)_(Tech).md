**Automatic Loom (Hemp)** is [](Crafting_Tech.md) research which allows the player to
construct a Hemp Auto-Loom. This is the [Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink")
equivalent of [](Automatic_Loom_(Cotton)_(Tech).md).

This research can be helpful for players who craft a lot of armour and
create [Fabrics](Fabrics.md "wikilink") from Hemp. Though caution should be
taken as **Hemp** is considered to be Illegal by the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md).

**Dust Bosses**are squad leaders of the [](Dust_Bandits.md), who can be found leading groups of
their fellow outlaws in their territory. They are stronger than their
comrades, and may approach player characters with their group in tow to
mug them. The player may either pay a fair sum of
[Cats](Cats.md "wikilink") and be left alone, or refuse the offer, which
initiates a fight.

They lead squads with 5-10 [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandit.md "wikilink") which
are sometimes accompanied by up to 4 [](Dust_Bandit_Bowman.md). These squads can be found
roaming [Shem](Shem.md "wikilink") or the [](Border_Zone.md).

They also populate [Dust Bandit Camps](Dust_Bandit_Camp.md "wikilink"),
which spawn in the aforementioned biomes, with the addition of
[Skinner's Roam](Skinner's_Roam.md "wikilink"). These camps contain 3 Dust
Bandit squads, which are slightly larger than their roaming
counterparts.

They can also be found in the [](Dust_King_Tower.md) as guards, in a large group of 5-6.

Finally, they lead the [Bandit Demands](Bandit_Demands.md "wikilink") event
squad which is sent to the player's outpost if it lies within the Dust
Bandits' zone of control.

They have a 25% chance to have a bounty between 1000 and 3000 cats for
the [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink"), [](Holy_Nation.md), and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md).

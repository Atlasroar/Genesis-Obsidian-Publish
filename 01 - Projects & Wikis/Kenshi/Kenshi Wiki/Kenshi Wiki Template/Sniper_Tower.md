**Sniper Tower** has many [](Upgraded_Watchbot.md) Skeletons manning Mk 2 Harpoons
at the top of the tower.

Interestingly, they are all facing northwards - preventing players from
using the pits as an easy access point to the
[Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink").

Be aware that like all turrets, these can fire in nearly 360 degrees.
The first character or two reaching the roof will be hit with multiple
harpoons. Heavy armor with 100% coverage is recommended.

If you are able to clear the tower (or are particularly brave), the 3rd
floor contains [Beds](Bed.md "wikilink") with the usual 8x healing
multiplier for non-skeleton characters. Unfortunately, only one bed can
be used due to junk placement, but it's possible to clip characters in
by picking them up.

Beware! The liquid surrounding this area is not regular water but acid.

**Pearl Vases** can be found in Residential Buildings. When starting
out, stealing this item along with other junk can help players increase
their [Thievery](Thievery.md "wikilink") stat with little risk (if the
building is empty) and reward.

It is quite possible that this item is made from [](Leviathan_Pearl.md), alongside other pearl-related
things such as [Pearl Urn](Pearl_Urn.md "wikilink"), [](Pearl_Cup.md) and [](Pearl_Sword_Holder.md).

This [item](Items.md "wikilink") is also used in the construction of [](Thief_Training_Boxes.md). As many other
Pearl items, it can be bought from the [](Hive_Trader.md) in Hive villages.

This is a guide to how to [alter](:Category:Modding "wikilink") the
controlling [Faction](Faction.md "wikilink") of a town before starting a
game and while having already started a game by fiddling with the save
file with the use of the [](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md).

Before having started any game, to change the town ownership in the FCS
one has to:

1.  Open the FCS and create a new mod while having the 4 base files
    loaded.
2.  Click "continue" and go to the "Towns" menu.
3.  Double-click on the town you want to edit and add the new faction
    that is going to control the town in the "faction" option.
4.  Remove the old faction.

One can also make use of the "town overrides" function:

1.  Open the FCS and create a new mod while having the 4 base files
    loaded.
2.  Click "continue" and create a new "town override" in "Towns".
3.  Add the recipient faction in the town override with the new
    residents of the town.

After having started a game, to change the town ownership in the FCS one
has to:

1.  Open the FCS and load the save file in "open any".
2.  Use the search bar to find a town of the recipient faction.
3.  Open the town state for any town you want the recipient faction to
    own (the Hub, for example) and change the controlling faction to the
    recipient faction.

These methods work the same way to make the player faction (Nameless)
the new owner of the town.

Do note that it was never intended for the player to gain ownership of
towns, so all these are cheats and may cause unforeseen problems. Also,
this is a "good" way to avoid raids, as the raiders get confused where
your outpost is if you build another one besides the town.

It is heavily advised when changing the town ownership to the player
faction to do the following:

1.  Go to town you want to claim.
2.  Open ingame editor with "SHIFT + F12".
3.  Select Town Placement and search for the name of the town you are
    in.
4.  Click on the name of the town you are in and then the town marker
    statue should vanish.
5.  Find "Your outpost" in the town placement menu and place it where
    the old town marker was.
6.  Save and reload the save so that changes are applied.

Do note, that if the town marker change is not saved to a mod, it is
very likely next time you import the town ownership goes back to
original owner.

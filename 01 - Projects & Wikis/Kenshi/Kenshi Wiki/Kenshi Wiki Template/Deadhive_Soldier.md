![](Deadhive-Soldier.png "Deadhive-Soldier.png") **Deadhive Soldier** is
a [Race](Races.md "wikilink") in Kenshi. Deadhive Soldier is a subrace of
[Hive](Hive.md "wikilink"). This race is used exclusively for [](Fog_Heavy.md) characters.

Compared to the [](Hive_Soldier_Drone.md), the Deadhive Soldier has only
half as much HP in the Head body part, making it 100 instead of 200, the
same as a [Human](Human.md "wikilink"). They also bleed slower with a rate
0f 0.2 instead of 0.3, and have a greater hunger rate of 1 instead of
0.6.

When comparing experience multipliers, Deadhive Soldiers don't have the
standard bonus in [Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink"), instead having a
+10% bonus in [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink"). They also don't have the
penalties in [Perception](Perception.md "wikilink"), like their
[Southern-Hive equivalent](Southern_Hive_Soldier_Drone.md "wikilink").

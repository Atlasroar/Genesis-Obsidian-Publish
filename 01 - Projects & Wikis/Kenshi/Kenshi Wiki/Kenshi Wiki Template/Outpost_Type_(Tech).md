**Outpost Type Tech** allows the player to build Outpost Type
structures, [Outpost s-III](Outpost_s-III.md "wikilink") and [](Outpost_s-IV.md). This tech is **not** available with the
[Research Bench](Research_Bench.md "wikilink") only: you must obtain
[Advanced Outpost Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink") and use it to
unlock this research tree.

**Okran's Valley** is a zone located in the northern part of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md)'s territory. It is aptly named as
'Valley' for being between 2 mountains both called [](Arm_of_Okran.md), and like many other territories which
HN control, it is named after their God [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink").

It is characterized for having approximately 1/3rd of grass lands and
2/3rds of desert lands, with the gradual transition between grass -
desert beginning at the southern part of this region. At it's
southernmost portion, the land is blanketed by a forest of coniferous
trees whilst the northern lands begins its transition to desert as it
connects to United Cities lands.

Holy army patrols can be seen patrolling this region regularly, and it's
possible to occasionally see large groups of [](Scrawny_Cannibal.md) invading from [](Northern_Coast.md).

There are few farms in this region, with the most northern part in
ruins.![](Arm_of_Okran_and_Okran's_Valley_World_Map_Crop_001.jpg "Arm_of_Okran_and_Okran's_Valley_World_Map_Crop_001.jpg")

**Fog Princes** are the leaders of the [Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink")
faction. They each have a bounty of c. 6,000. Fog Princes are never
alone in the wild, often surrounded by [Fogmen](Fogman.md "wikilink") and
[Fog Heavies](Fog_Heavy.md "wikilink"). Seeking the Princes out in the fog,
even with several well equipped combatants, can be very unforgiving.

Fortunately, Fogmen often attempt to attack
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"), including Fog Princes. Mongrel's [](Shinobi_Guard.md) are more than capable of defending the
town. Before being defeated, Fog Princes usually reach the Mongrel
Barracks, however some Princes can be defeated before even entering the
city gates. Fog Princes can be difficult to spot in large piles of
Fogmen, but their distinct yellow blood and round head shape helps.
Another method of spotting them is looking for the [](Ninja_Blade.md) they wield. After looting their heads
from their bodies, the bounties can be earned by simply selling the
heads to any vendor.

It is also possible to steal the Fog Prince head from imprisoned Fog
Princes in the Watchtower.

Fog Princes can also be found in the [](Tower_of_Fog.md) and [](Deadhive_Overrun.md). They are often attracted to [](Fog_Deathyard.md) prisoners and can be found eating
the captive.

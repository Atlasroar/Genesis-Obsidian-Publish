**The Hub** is a town of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md) located near the center of The
[Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink"). The [bar](Barman.md "wikilink") in
The Hub is owned by the [Trade Ninjas](Trade_Ninjas.md "wikilink"), who
also occupy a nearby location known as the [](Rebel_Base.md). The [](Shinobi_Thieves.md) occupy a watchtower at a far end of
the settlement.

Many characters can potentially be found at the bar here. Most notably,
(Hobbs will be in the Hub if spawn settings are 2.0 when starting out)
[Hobbs](Hobbs.md "wikilink") might ask the player to come have a drink with
him. Other possible bar squads include [](Bar_Thug_Drunk.md). You start in The Hub when using [The
Wanderer](https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Starts#Wanderer), The Holy
Sword and [Son of a
Captain](https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Starts#Son_of_a_Captain)
game starts, and a chance to start there with the Nobodies start. If you
are not starting out in The Hub it is possible to place it on your map
by reading the [Map of the Border Zone](Maps.md "wikilink") or just running
to it yourself.

The [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") pacifier can be found here.

## Lore

The Hub is in the [Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink"), a contested
region between the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") and the [](Holy_Nation.md). The history of the Hub is written in a
series of notes that can be found in the Small Shack that is not in
ruins. That building contains 5 letters in total:

- [Ludin's Reports](Ludin's_Reports.md "wikilink") (3 total notes)
- [Priest Varloo's Note](Priest_Varloo's_Note.md "wikilink")
- [Priest Tyluig's Note](Priest_Tyluig's_Note.md "wikilink")

The notes reveal that the Hub was once part of the [](Holy_Nation.md). The Holy Nation military made several
attempts to retake the city but would inevitably lose it within months.
The [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") occupied the Hub for some
time, but eventually sacked the city and set it ablaze before
retreating. After that, a Holy Nation squad was sent to the ruins to
investigate. They spotted some "shadowy figures" in the city, but didn't
find any enemies to fight. After losing a [Bonedog](Bonedog.md "wikilink")
and one of the Sentinel to some unseen force picking them off, the Holy
Nation soldiers retreated, claiming the ruins are haunted by "wraiths".
It is implied that the same "wraiths" (presumably the [](Trade_Ninjas.md) and/or the [](Shinobi_Thieves.md) and/or [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md)) have driven the Shek soldiers
out by using the same tactics.

## Tips

- You can make an outpost just outside the walls (for example in a
  valley to the West). With careful management, production lines can be
  established from resource-gathering operations outside the Hub and to
  the resource-processing production chains inside the [](Player-Owned_Buildings_in_Town.md) in the Hub.
- Several copper and iron nodes within walking distance from the gates
  make it possible to run a fairly safe mining operation inside of the
  Hub. (Purchase a Small Shack, research ore storage and build a storage
  box for the material you wish to mine. Then hold Shift + Click on an
  ore vein close enough to The Hub to assign mining it as a job. The
  character should haul the ores to the storage container without
  needing to assign a new job)
- The small shack that is not ruined contains two
  [Bed](Bed.md "wikilink")[s](Bed.md "wikilink") that can help speed up the
  healing rate of your characters.
- There are many buildings for sale in The Hub, but they are collapsed
  and in need of repair. This leads to cheaper prices for the real
  estate, but requires extra effort to collect [](Building_Materials.md) to repair them. Once the
  houses are functional, buildings such as a [](Research_Bench.md) can be built inside, allowing for
  the player to reach a much higher tech level before heading out and
  building their own outpost.
- Even if purchased you still need to repair the buildings in order to
  build inside of them. It'd be wise to repair the building closest to
  the Shinobi Thieves, so they will run out to protect you if attacked
  (Assuming they are allied).
- [Dust Bandit Camps](Dust_Bandit_Camp.md "wikilink") can spawn near The
  Hub - you can bait them to follow you to the Shinobi Thieves' den and,
  if you are allied with them, they will be killed swiftly and can be
  looted for good early-game armour.
- If you run to the Shinobi Den, you will Ninja-step across the ledge of
  the ruined building just outside their base. If you path to the space
  between the buildings instead, you can step through in 2 clicks, and
  any following bandits will run through the ledge instead. This buys
  you time to enter the Tower, from which Ninjas will then defend you.

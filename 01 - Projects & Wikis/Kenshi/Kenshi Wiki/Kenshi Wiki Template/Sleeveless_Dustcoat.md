dark leather. A collar protects the neck of the character. The coat is
held shut by a leather belt that wraps around the waist of the character

against harsh weather environments.

## Stats

## Crafting

It can theoretically be crafted on the [](Leather_Armour_Crafting_Bench.md) after researching the
blueprints.

Although there is a blueprint for this item in game files, that
blueprint is nowhere to be found in game. There are however, few mods
you can download which fixes this missing blueprint issue and many more
(like the infamous missing recipe of the [](Ration_Pack.md)).

**Hive Attack**, not to be confused with the [](Hive_Attack_(Southern_Hive).md), is an
[Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger when the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has kidnapped [](The_Queen.md). It has a 100% chance to trigger if the
player has a [Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within
50,000 meters of a [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") location, but
given that distance is larger than the map of Kenshi and the event
ignores No-Go zones, it will trigger anywhere in the map with the same
frequency.

When the conditions are fulfilled, the Western Hive will send an assault
to the player's base. This assault will consist of 9 squads, each made
up of 9 [Soldier Drones](Soldier_Drone.md "wikilink").

When the assault arrives, the War Leader will shout about the queen,
then order the attack, attacking gate and characters, and liberating
captives. If the assault is defeated, another Hive Attack event will be
triggered in 24-48 hours.

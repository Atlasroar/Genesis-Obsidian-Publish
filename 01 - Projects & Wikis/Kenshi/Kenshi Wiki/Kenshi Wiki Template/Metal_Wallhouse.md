**Metal Wallhouse** is a type of building found in locations mostly
inhabited by [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink"), such as [](Black_Desert_City.md) (Skeletons only) and
[Spring](Spring.md "wikilink") (Skeletons and others). It has 3 floors
connected by stairs and appears to be made from scrap. The very top
level under an open sky is big enough to fit a [](Research_Bench.md) level II. A [](Small_Wind_Generator.md) can be built on the roof.
This type of building cannot be constructed by the player.

### Skeleton Storage

An occupied variant of the Metal Wallhouse exists in Black Scratch. It
appears to be filled with various containers of hi-tech junk loot that
may include[Power Cores](Power_Core.md "wikilink") and [](CPU_Unit.md). They also house a number of [](Skeleton_Repair_Bed.md). The very top floor always
has a Small Water Tank.

[Gatherer villages](Gatherer_Village.md "wikilink").

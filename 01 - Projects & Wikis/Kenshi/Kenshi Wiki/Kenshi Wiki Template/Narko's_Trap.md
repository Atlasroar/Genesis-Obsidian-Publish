**Narko's Trap** is a [Minor Outpost](Minor_Outposts.md "wikilink")
controlled by [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"). Due to
their hatred and fear of ancient technologies, the Holy Nation have set
up a small military outpost around the only known ancient laboratory in
their territory, to prevent would-be thieves and tech hunters from
purloining the forbidden knowledge within.

This location can be discovered by travelling here or through reading
the **[Secret Holy Nation Documents](Maps.md "wikilink")**.

The location itself consists of two parts: the Holy Nation military base
manned by [unique paladins](Paladin_Guardian.md "wikilink"), who will
immediately attack and remove any intruders and/or Agents of Narko from
the premises, and, more importantly, an [](Ancient_Tech_Lab.md) called [](Narko's_Evil_Tower.md)**.**

The lab itself is walled in and is home to hostile [](Security_Spider.md), which can be defeated, snuck past,
or left for any paladins in pursuit. Aside from the normal ancient lab
loot, the tower has a high amount of possible [](Research_Artifacts.md), including [](AI%20Core.md), as well as a guaranteed [](Map_of_the_Ashlands.md).

Note that due to the proximity of this location to the
[Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink"), characters can get hit by acid rain
if they accidentally move too far.

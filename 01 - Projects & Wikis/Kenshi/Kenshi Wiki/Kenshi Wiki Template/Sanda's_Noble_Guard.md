**Sanda's Noble Guards** are elite bodyguards of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md). They are found exclusively in [](Lady_Sanda.md) retinue, in a group of 5 to 8.

They can be visually differentiated from the normal [](Hooded_Empire_Noble_Guard.md) variant by the lack of a
hood and the high-quality topper. 

## Trivia

- In the base game (and specifically in FCS), Sanda's guards are
  incorrectly named as *"empire noble guard---"*s, with the three dashes
  indicating that they may not have been intended to appear at all. This
  has been corrected in the [Naming Fixes
  Project](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2277236149).

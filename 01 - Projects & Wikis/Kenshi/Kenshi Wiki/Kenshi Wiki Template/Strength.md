Strength affects carrying capacity, the ability to efficiently use
weapons at normal speed with blunt damage, and the effectiveness of
[Blunt Damage](Blunt_Weapons.md "wikilink") and [](Martial_Arts.md). If you lack the required strength to use
a weapon or are encumbered your [Combat Speed](Combat_Speed.md "wikilink")
will be penalized. The formula for carrying capacity is 15 + strength.

In combat, your Strength XP is mostly gained by attacking. Every strike
you land, even if blocked by the enemy, grants you Strength XP.
Successful blocks also grant you 40% of the experience that landing a
hit would give. Getting hit without blocking grants you 10% of the
Strength XP.

Strength—like [Armour Smithing](Armour_Smith.md "wikilink") and [](Weapon_Smith.md)—affects the bulk of your character.
At level 1 Strength, a character will display as fairly thin and frail.
At 100 Strength, they will appear much larger and bulkier. This is not
to be confused with [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"), [](Martial_Arts.md), [Athletics](Athletics.md "wikilink"), and
[Swimming](Swimming.md "wikilink"), which increase the
definition/visibility of the muscles. [Cooking](Cooking.md "wikilink") and
[Science](Science.md "wikilink"), on the other hand, have a negative effect
on muscle definition. Lack of feeding-increasing hunger decreases your
strength stat. Every 1 Hunger below 200 will debuff your STR by 0.9%, to
a maximum of -90% at 100 Hunger.

All weapons—including unarmed [](Martial_Arts.md)—have a required Strength level equal to
40x the blunt damage value of the weapon or 1x the weight of the weapon,
whichever is greater. The required Strength for Martial Arts is
equivalent to 80% of the Martial Arts level. Weapon weight modifiers are
ignored when calculating the required Strength level. Failing to meet
the required Strength level will result in massive [](Combat_Speed.md) penalties up to a maximum of -47.5%.
(When 20 STR or below)

Strength also determines the amount of blood that
[Human](Human.md "wikilink") and [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") characters have.
Blood = 75+STR(0.75)

## Improving Strength

One safe way to train strength is to fill a backpack with [](Raw_Iron.md), [](Generator_Core.md), or other heavy items. Either a
[Shopkeepers Backpack](Shopkeepers_Backpack.md "wikilink") or wooden
backpack can be used. When the backpack is filled, put it in your
inventory without wearing it. You will then have all the weight inside
the backpack applied to your character. Have your character follow a
guard or policeman around a city; they will continue to walk around
while carrying this weight, accumulating strength experience rather
quickly and autonomously. Another great place to walk if you wish to
train AFK is to follow raptors on Raptor Island.

At 70% [Encumbrance](Encumbrance.md "wikilink") a maximum of 25% Strength
XP is reached. Further Encumbrance only diminishes the Athletics XP
gain. You can push this to 50% by carrying any character or creature.
Carrying another character also adds 30 weight to your encumbrance.

If you have a party of more than 1 person, you can further train
strength by ordering one of your people to carry the other via the 'pick
up' command (hold down the right mouse button on the character you wish
to carry) and ordering the carrier to walk as usual. This can also be
achieved by picking up a corpse or unconscious character. Please note
however that any weight carried by the character you are holding will
not increase your strength gains.

The fastest way to train Strength is through combat. Using a weapon that
has a required Strength (see the introductory section) that is 20 levels
over your character's Strength level will gain you a fair amount of (STR
XP 110%) XP per swing. Swinging a weapon which gives you 110% STR XP
will grant 11x the STR XP for swinging one with 10%. The more targets
hit, the better.

Alternatively, you can overload your inventory as explained above and
then go fight using [Martial Arts](Martial_Arts.md "wikilink"). Each hit
you make will give a nice boost to Strength XP. The XP gained per hit is
based off your Encumbrance amount. Every 1% Encumbrance = 1% STR XP in
combat. Therefore, when maxed out on Encumbrance (100%) you will gain XP
equal to that of a weapon which gives you 100% STR XP. Remember, though,
that encumbrance slows a character down to the point where running away
from a fight is near impossible. The encumbrance also significantly
diminishes the character's dodge as well as dodge XP gain.

## Trivia

- **Strength** suffers more penalties from malnutrition, while
  [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink") suffers more penalties from damaged
  body parts and armor penalties.
- If you do not like how bulky your character has gotten, you may want
  to go to a [Plastic Surgeon](Plastic_Surgeon.md "wikilink") to change
  your appearance. Alternatively, you can make yourself start out
  looking very skinny, and look more normal as you train your stats.

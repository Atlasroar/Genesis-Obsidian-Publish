The Kenshi world map is vast and multi-colored. Kenshi has many zones
with natural, earthy designs which are at odds with more outlandish
areas like [Leviathan Coast](Leviathan_Coast.md "wikilink"),
[Gut](Gut.md "wikilink"), and [Venge](Venge.md "wikilink").

Kenshi has many non-player locations, of sizes ranging from a single
building to large cities. The game includes a [](World_States.md) system which creates reactions to
deaths of notable people. These reactions to power vacuums can result in
new locations spawning or in towns being [](Town_Overrides.md) by new [Factions](Factions.md "wikilink").

Zones in Kenshi are not just aesthetic, as they have specific [](Environment.md), resource availability, and
[seasons](Seasons_and_Weather.md "wikilink"). These factors come into play
when players are [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md). Even without
building anything, weather can give players pause as harmful [](Weather_Effects.md) can occur all across the map.

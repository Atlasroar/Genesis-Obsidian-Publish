## Tips

- After getting knocked out by members of the Black Dog HQ they become
  passive and will not attack for some time. (Or unless stolen from) You
  can even pick all the locks in the building to get loot like the
  Masterwork Dark Leather Shirt which spawns in the metal chest on the
  bottom floor.
- Their beds are public to use... Provided you can sneak in, or like the
  prior tip are knocked out by them first.

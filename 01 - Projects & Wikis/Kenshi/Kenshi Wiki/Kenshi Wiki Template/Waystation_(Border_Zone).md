This [Waystation](Waystation.md "wikilink") is a small outpost in the
center of the landmass. It is found in the easternmost area of the
Borderlands. Waystation is controlled by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md). Its residents include [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Mercenary_Guild.md) members. This is the only waystation
with a robotics workshop.

It can be discovered by reading the **[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the
Border Zone.**

This location is a good place to rest, especially after being harassed
by a group of [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandits.md "wikilink") or [](Starving_Bandits.md). It is a good place to sell items
looted from the nearby ruins such as [](Tiny_Settlement.md) and [](Ruined_Holy_Outpost.md).

As with all other non-ruined Waystations, this place has a 25% chance to
spawn pacifiers from [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), [](Traders_Guild.md), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

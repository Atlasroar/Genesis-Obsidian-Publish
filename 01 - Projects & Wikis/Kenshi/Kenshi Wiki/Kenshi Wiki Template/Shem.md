**Shem** is a sandy oasis area with [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink")
and [Bloodspiders](Blood_Spider.md "wikilink"), likely wandered in from the
neighboring Venge. It is home to [Nomads](Nomads.md "wikilink") as well as
Smugglers from the [Grayflayers](Grayflayers.md "wikilink") gang.

Smugglers Bar is a location worth remembering, especially for players
travelling through nearby [Venge](Venge.md "wikilink"). There are numerous
Beds and, short of kidnapping [Big Gray](Big_Gray.md "wikilink"), there
isn't any reason for the Grayflayers to be hostile to the player.

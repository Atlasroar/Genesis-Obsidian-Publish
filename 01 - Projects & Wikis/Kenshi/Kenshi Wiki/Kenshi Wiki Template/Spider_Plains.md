The **Spider Plains** are a large hilly field filled with [](Skin_Spider.md) (likely originating from the
neighboring [Arach](Arach.md "wikilink")), alongside several Shek bandits
such as [Berserkers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink"), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md) and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md).

### Tips

- The main enemy, [Skin Spiders](Skin_Spider.md "wikilink"), are slow, and
  most pawns can easily outrun them. Bring [](Splint_Kit.md), as this allows you to pick your fights.
- Bring a weapon with special bonuses on animals and/or spiders, such as
  the [Desert Saber](Desert_Sabre.md "wikilink") or a
  [Polearm](Polearms.md "wikilink").
- Skin Spiders eat KOed pawns, do not hesitate to run away if you
  believe your pawn is at risk.
- Skin Spiders are vulnerable to being kited (hitting an enemy and
  running away to avoid retaliation), use a long reach or
  [Ranged](Crossbows.md "wikilink") weapon to capitalize on this weakness.

## Trivia

- Being a zone that directly neighbours [Arach](Arach.md "wikilink"), it is
  likely that several of the Skin Spiders in this region might have
  migrated from that region.

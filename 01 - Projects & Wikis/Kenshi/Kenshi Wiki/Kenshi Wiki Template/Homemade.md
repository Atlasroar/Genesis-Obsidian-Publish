**Homemade** weapons are weapons crafted by players using the [](Weapon_Smithing_Bench.md). The model made is
determined by several factors:

- The character's [Weapon Smith](Weapon_Smith.md "wikilink") skill, with
  each model being unlocked in 5 or 10 level intervals. The skill also
  determines critical chance - the chance to create a weapon one model
  higher than normally allowed.
- The [Weapon Smithing Bench](Weapon_Smithing_Bench.md "wikilink"). Barring
  criticals, a level 1 Bench will allow crafting until Refitted Blade
  quality, a level 2 Bench will allow until Catun No. 3 quality, and a
  level 3 Bench will allow the maximum researchable quality Edge Type 1.
- Unlocked Research. Each level of [](Basic_Weapon_Grades_(Tech).md) allows crafting weapons
  until Catun No. 1 quality. [](Advanced_Weapon_Grades_(Tech).md) is required for
  crafting models until Mk III quality, and
  [Edgewalkers](Edgewalkers_(Tech).md "wikilink") is required for the Edge
  Type 1 quality.

Any weapon made by the [player faction](Nameless.md "wikilink") will appear
as created by this manufacturer, along with the name of the specific
smith of player's faction who made it (for example "Ruka of Nameless").
Playing with faction name and smith's name can lead to interesting
results such as "Weapon of Hunters" for a weapon made by a character
named "Weapon" of the "Hunters" faction or "Side Blade of Archers" made
by a character named "Side Blade" of the "Archers" faction. With a heavy
reliance on the [Plastic Surgeon](Plastic_Surgeon.md "wikilink") this trick
can be used to standardize the weapons and create uniform sets of
weapons (and [armour](Armour_Smith.md "wikilink")).

When compared to other manufacturers, Homemade weapons have no inherent
bonus or penalty. As such, Homemade weapons are the standard for weapon
values. In game, however, usually translates to Homemade weapons being
slightly inferior to the equal model of another Manufacturer. For
example, they have lesser blunt damage (but are lighter) than the [](Catun_Scrapmasters.md)' weapons and lesser cut
damage than the [Edgewalkers](Edgewalkers.md "wikilink")' weapons. The only
case in which Homemade weapons are superior (damage wise) to normal
Manufacturer weapons is at [Ancient](Ancient_(Manufacturer).md "wikilink")
quality as they suffer from a 0.9x cut damage modifier. You are unable
to (Even if you crit) smith Homemade Edge Type 3 weapons.

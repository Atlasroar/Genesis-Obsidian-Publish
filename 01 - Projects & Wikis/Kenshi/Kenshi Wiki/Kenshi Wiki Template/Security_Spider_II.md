A smaller version of the standard [](Security_Spider.md). They have far less HP and strength
than regular Security Spiders. Their smaller size also lets them
maneuver more easily in cluttered terrain or indoors around furniture.
They can be found guarding the bar in [](Black_Desert_City.md), as well as
[Scraphouse](Scraphouse.md "wikilink"), the [](Secret_Drug_Farm.md) in [](Stobe's_Gamble.md), multiple armories and the [](Armor_King.md)'s shop in the [](Drowned_Ruins.md) of [Wend](Wend.md "wikilink").

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which Security
Spiders II have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

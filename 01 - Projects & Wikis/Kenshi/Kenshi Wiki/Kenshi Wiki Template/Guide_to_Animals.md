Animals play a large role in Kenshi. There are many
[Zones](:Category:Zones "wikilink") which are considered dangerous
exclusively due to the animals which inhabit that zone. Animals can
range from herbivores, scavengers, or man-eating predators. Animals can
own locations such as [Tower of Goats](Tower_of_Goats.md "wikilink") and
[Tower of Spiders](Tower_of_Spiders.md "wikilink"), however a majority of
animal locations are randomly spawning [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink"). Many
animals only spawn in [](Heng_(Zone).md#Homeless_Spawns) in Zones, either in
squads or alone. [Robotic (synthetic) animals](Robots.md "wikilink") share
some of the characteristics of living animals.

Certain animals can be [](Playable_Characters.md) after being purchased from
Animal Traders. These Animal Player Characters come with their own risks
and benefits.

## Wild Animals

### Carnivorous Animals

These animals will eat unconscious characters. Characters may be
awakened from unconsciousness in a desperate attempt to save their
lives, but often characters remain unconscious throughout being eaten
alive. Importantly, Beak Things are the only carnivorous animal with a
sense of smell. This means they can follow the scent of blood to the
location of a fight, ongoing or finished. Blood Spiders and Skin Spiders
will only eat victims they fought or whose bodies they happen upon
accidentally. They can't follow the scent of blood over a significant
distance.

- [Beak Thing](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") - Will eat a unit from bottom to
  top. (With right leg first, followed by left leg and so on)
- [Blood Spider](Blood_Spider.md "wikilink") - "Sucks nutrition" instead of
  eating limbs.
- [Skin Spider](Skin_Spider.md "wikilink") - "Sucks nutrition" instead of
  eating limbs.

### Scavenger Animals

These animals will eat dead bodies, but not living ones. One bizarre
exception is that Skimmers will *only* eat corpses if they spawn in a
nest. All other scavengers have an innate desire to eat them. Of the
list below, the only animals that will actively seek out corpses are
Bonedogs, Boneyard Wolves, River Raptors, and Swamp Raptors.

- [Black Gorillo](Black_Gorillo.md "wikilink")
- [Bonedog](Bonedog.md "wikilink")
- [Boneyard Wolf](Boneyard_Wolf.md "wikilink")
- [Gorillo](Gorillo.md "wikilink")
- [Land Bat](Landbat.md "wikilink")
- [River Raptor](River_Raptor.md "wikilink")
- [Swamp Raptor](Swamp_Raptor.md "wikilink")
- [Skimmer](Skimmer.md "wikilink")

### Territorial Animals

These animals are either patrolling an area or are nesting animals which
will become hostile if characters enter their territory.

- [Beak Thing](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink")
- [Bonedog](Bonedog.md "wikilink")
- [Boneyard Wolf](Boneyard_Wolf.md "wikilink")
- [Crab](Crab.md "wikilink")
- [Gorillo](Gorillo.md "wikilink")
- [Leviathan](Leviathan.md "wikilink") - May become hostile if the
  Leviathan is a loner and if you have a squad of 3 or more.
- [Skimmer](Skimmer.md "wikilink")

### Hungry Animals

These animals may choose to eat growing crops at a player outpost, which
triggers the player characters to fight them. Often these animal attacks
can be prevented by clearing out nearby Nests before they seek out an
outpost's farms.

- [River Raptor](River_Raptor.md "wikilink")
- [Swamp Raptor](Swamp_Raptor.md "wikilink")

### Apathetic Animals

These animals will primarily roam in groups and will not initiate combat
with characters on sight.

- [Goat](Goat.md "wikilink") - Excluding the Goats in the [](Tower_of_Goats.md).
- [Swamp Turtle](Swamp_Turtle.md "wikilink")
- [Wild Bull](Wild_Bull.md "wikilink")

### Defensive Animals

These animals are normally neutral but can be provoked without attacking
them. Similar to territorial animals, but they do not have a fixed
territory or nest.

- [Garru](Garru.md "wikilink") - Wild Garru may growl when the player moves
  nearby. If this happens and the player stops moving (disable jobs and
  press R) and remains still, the Garru will remain peaceful. However,
  if the player continues moving near them, the herd may attack. The
  herd may also attack if another squad enters combat with the Garru.
  One of your characters will say something if the Garru might attack.
  letting you know the stop moving.

### Relics and Robots

Many regions of Kenshi are heavily damaged environmentally. In these
areas, [Robots](Robots.md "wikilink") take the place of wildlife.

### Mega Animal Variations

Mega Animals are rare versions of regular animals and comparatively have
very high stats, especially body part health. Mega Animals can be found
in a single set location.

- [Great White Gorillo](Great_White_Gorillo.md "wikilink")
- [King Gorillo](King_Gorillo.md "wikilink")
- [Megacrab](Megacrab.md "wikilink")
- [Megaraptor](Megaraptor.md "wikilink")

## Purchasable Animals

You can buy these and play them like regular characters! While they are
rated in every skill—just like typical humanoid characters—they can't
actually use very many (eg. Goats can't use Armor Smith, even if highly
proficient).

### Vendors

The primary faction to purchase animals from is the
[Nomads](Nomads.md "wikilink"). The nomads can consistently be found in
their two towns, [Settled Nomads](Settled_Nomads.md "wikilink") and
[Settled Nomad Village](Settled_Nomad_Village.md "wikilink"). They can also
potentially spawn Merchant Nomads in many zones. These merchants sell
[Goats](Goat.md "wikilink"), [Pack Beasts](Pack_Beast.md "wikilink"),
[Bonedogs](Bonedog.md "wikilink"), [Pack Bulls](Pack_Bull.md "wikilink"), and
[Wild Bulls](Wild_Bull.md "wikilink"). The Nomads also have [](Goat_Herder.md), who exclusively sell goats. In Settled
Nomad Village, [Cornelius](Cornelius.md "wikilink") can be purchased from
[Goat Man](Goat_Man.md "wikilink").

[The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") has [](Holy_Farms.md) which players can purchase animals from.
The [Holy Farm Leader](Holy_Farm_Leader.md "wikilink") will sell players
[Bonedogs](Bonedog.md "wikilink") and [](Domesticated_Bull.md).

The [Crab Raiders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink") sell
[Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink") in both of their towns. Players do not need to
be allied with the Crab Raiders in order to purchase crabs from them.

### Health

Animal player characters cannot lose limbs. However, due to what is most
likely an oversight, the limbs description will read that it is
destroyed and useless like it would when a limb is lost for humanoids.
In due time the limb will heal normally, despite the text. There aren't
animal specific beds, however a humanoid player character can pick up an
animal and place it in a bed manually. While animals are unconscious
their heal speed is doubled. (Maybe due to a bug) If placed in a bed
when unconscious an animal will only have their heal speed doubled until
they regain consciousness. Many [](Hostile_Factions.md) can potentially attempt to chop
up your animals for food. Animal player characters will automatically
eat any available food out of a [Backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") or an
[Animal Feeder](Animal_Feeder.md "wikilink"). Animals will also pick up
food which is not stolen, dropped on the ground near them. Bonedogs will
also grab severed limbs to eat.

All animals which can be purchased/controlled have a stat called "self
healing". What this stat does is provided an animal is conscious their
wounds will not degenerate, and they will automatically have bandaged
health applied to them equal to 40% of the health they would normally
heal.

### Abilities

All purchasable animals can fight, with **Pack Bulls** being the most
effective in running down their two-legged opponents.

**Bulls** and **Garrus** can wear backpacks that stack certain items in
stacks up to five and six respectively. Pack animals backpacks have a
massive -90% encumbrance on their backpacks allowing them to carry much
more than any human can without slowing down.

Animals can be used as "cheap" scouts and decoys in battle. Note that
the cost of using them in this way could amount to one animal per use.
**Goats** and **Bonedogs** are recommended as they are easier to replace
in numbers from animal vendors.

Note that most (adult to elder) animals (With the exception of Goats)
cannot normally enter into buildings and therefore benefit from their
safety and services inside. They can, however, be carried into a
building and walk out on their own later. Some animals, like Pack Bulls,
could be ordered to enter via a large door (for example into a
[Stationhouse](Stationhouse.md "wikilink")) and they will comply with the
order they would not normally execute. Sometimes even large animals such
a Bulls can also enter buildings when executing a "staying close"
command.

### Racial Animal Weapons

Like all characters in Kenshi, animals use weapons behind the scenes to
attack with. These directly modify the damage output from their stats.
They are also slightly randomized, so an animal may be slightly stronger
or weaker depending on the "weapon" it spawned with.

Of note, the weapon selected randomizes every game load, using a seed
generated from squad data. Shuffling your squad members around in the
list, then saving and reloading, will potentially cause your animals to
spawn with a different weapon model. This can change damage by very
large amounts as the vast majority of their damage comes from stats.

For comparison to normal weapons, here are their damage values listed
below. For the damage formula for every animal (Excluding swamp turtles)
go to their actual page.

### Trivia

During development, the Kenshi Development Team has hinted that the
ability to tame certain animals could be added to the game. It was
supposed to be a luxury feature and bits and pieces in the FCS hinted at
this feature being developed. Most likely candidates for taming could
have been Beak Things and Crabs, since they already had eggs in the
game. [ru:Руководство по

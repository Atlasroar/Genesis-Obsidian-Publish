**Beds** are used for restoring the health of characters. Beds are used
to heal a player's wounds after they have been bandaged. Beds can be
found in [Towns](Towns.md "wikilink") or
[constructed](Construction.md "wikilink") in player buildings.

## Key Points

- Only one person can sleep in a bed at a time.
- Beds heal blunt wounds and bandaged portions of cut wounds up to 100%.
- If you are carrying an injured person or NPC, you can lay them in a
  bed to stop wounds from degenerating.
- Placing incapacitated NPCs in a bed results in a status gain with
  their [faction](Factions.md "wikilink").
- A bed heals at 8x the normal [](Guide_to_Health.md), twice as much as a [](Camp_Bed.md).
- Sleeping reduces [hunger](Food.md "wikilink") rate to 1/3.
- Beds can be rented in friendly towns or outposts from as little as 75
  [Cats](Cats.md "wikilink"). Beds are rented for 24 hours so a healed
  character can always leave the bed to give place to their wounded
  comrade as long as the clock has not run out.
- Typically, barracks and other private buildings have beds that are
  forbidden to sleep in. This can be bypassed if the player is "Allied"
  with the faction that owns the building.

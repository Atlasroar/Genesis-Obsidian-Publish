**Version 0.23** was a technical update, focusing mainly on stability
and performance improvements. Other than that, it was the first recorded
overhaul of the pathfinding system in Kenshi.

__TOC__

The long-overdue pathfinding update is finally out. It was a big one and
took quite a while as it involved completely tearing out and replacing
the pathfinding system.

This is purely a technical update, and adds no gameplay features. Sorry
about that, but it now paves the way for some fun-filled updates coming
up next.

This was a big overhaul, so new bugs may have been
introduced. Pathfinding is not a pretty subject when you are working on
a seamless game world.

The update should download automatically when you next start up the
game, or via Desura.

## 0.23.0

#### FEATURES

- Total pathfinding overhaul.
- Faster map loading times
- Improved frame rate
- reduced load times when entering buildings

#### BUG FIXES

- import squad to a new game now relocates your squad to the starting
  town.
- you can now set mouse horizontal/vertical speeds, use a negative
  number to invert the mouse control.
- Custom made launcher without any invalid options to choose.

#### NEW BUGS

- There is currently no character collision detection so they all stand
  in the same spot, I will add this back in asap.
- Splinting doesn't always work, I'm going to make it a separate action
  in the next update.

#### PLANNED FOR NEXT TIME

- Next I’m going to start on purchaseable buildings, and using them for
  basic stuff like sleeping and storage.

## 0.23.1

Another update has just been released. I have made a lot of fast updates
in the last week or so, sorting out all the major bugs. The game should
be pretty stable now.

Remember if you have a version earlier than 0.22.0 then the stupid
auto-updater won’t work, you will have to download the game again.

#### FEATURES

- characters now have collision

#### BUG FIXES

- fixed AI for wandering traders

## 0.23.2

#### BUG FIXES

- tried doing something that may have fixed the savegames crash
- fixed bug where backpacks could vanish when trading
- fixed stats window showing all zeros
- made it a little easier to place items in the inventory
- fixed bug where characters dont move normally after combat

## 0.23.3

#### FEATURES

- started working on building placement, but you don't get that yet.
  Hahar!

#### BUG FIXES

- character movement is not so flickering and jerky
- game now runs on single-core CPUs
- Fixed various stupid movement bugs
- fixed a random crash
- fixed some bugs with carrying characters

## 0.23.5

This is just a small stability fix until I release the next major update
coming very soon.

#### BUG FIXES

- Fixed the "thread error" crash
- Fixed some new crashes
- Fixed some long delays in loading NPCs after quickload

## 0.23.6

I’ve just released 0.23.6 through the auto-updater.  This should fix all
the major bugs now, particularly those crashes that were occuring.

I’ve now got the basics of building done, but its not in the update
yet.  I can build things but thats it.  Before I release it I want to
add doors, and some basic furniture for storage, sleeping and
imprisonment.  They should be the simplest features to add, so they will
be going in first.

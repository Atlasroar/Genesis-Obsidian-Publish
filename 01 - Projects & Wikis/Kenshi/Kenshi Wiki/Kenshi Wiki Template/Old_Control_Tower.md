The **Old Control Tower** is located in Venge, east of the [](Ruined_Control_Tower.md) and the [](Tower_of_Abuse.md). It is the home of the
[Scavengers](Scavengers.md "wikilink") and their leader
[Gutterhead](Gutterhead.md "wikilink"). The entire place has been ransacked
except for some small container, one of which is a secured wooden chest.
This chest can contain loot just as an [](Ancient_Labs.md) as per the
[Artifacts](Artifacts.md "wikilink") System.

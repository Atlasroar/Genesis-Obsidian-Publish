The **Border Zone** is an arid no-mans-land between the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) and the [](Holy_Nation.md) territories. This zone is included in
several of the [game starts](Game_Starts.md "wikilink"), often making it
the first area that the new players would see. It occupies the region of
the map south of [Okran's Pride](Okran's_Pride.md "wikilink") and east of
[Vain](Vain.md "wikilink").

It is a relatively forgiving area, most notable for its very large
quantity of [Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink") and [Copper](Copper.md "wikilink")
veins of high quality near towns with merchants that make it easy for
early-game [moneymaking](Money_Making_Strategies.md "wikilink"). However,
the various bandit factions that inhabit the region will be the downfall
of any fledgling outpost. The zone is occupied by groups of wandering
[Starving Bandits](Starving_Bandits.md "wikilink") and [](Dust_Bandits.md) who constantly harass each other, as
well as the player. Both the Dust Bandits and the Black Dragon Ninjas
have their fortified centres of banditry in this area.

The zone is also teeming with [Tech Hunters](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink")
(and even has a Tech Hunter settlement, known as
[Waystation](Waystation_(Border_Zone).md "wikilink"), in the South-East).
This zone was previously under [Holy Nation](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")
control, but their settlements are now in ruins. There are only two
major inhabited settlements in the region. The Shek town of Squin acts
as the main bastion standing between the Shek Kingdom and bandits of the
Border Zone and the many factions of [the Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink").
The former major city of the Holy Nation, The Hub, is now in ruins and
is partially controlled by various petty factions that cannot yet hope
to rebuild it into a major trading center.

## Environment

Aside from the occasional bandit menace and fairly balanced growth stats
for crops, the Border Zone is host to a lot of
[Bonedog](Bonedog.md "wikilink") packs. Rarely you may encounter a pack of
[goats](Goat.md "wikilink") or [Garru](Garru.md "wikilink") wandering through
your land, especially in the mountainous south or the canyons. This
region is also home to the enigmatic [Urchins](Urchin.md "wikilink"), which
are strewn across the landscape. Notable settlements in the Border Zone
are Squin, the Hub, and a Tech Hunter Waystation. With all of the
different factions and cities in close proximity to the area, the Border
Zone is one of the most diverse regions in the world as far as faction
selection and patrols go.

The only other noteworthy attribute of The Border Zone is its abundance
of ore in the region. [Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink") veins of 100% quality
can be found almost anywhere, but predominantly in the southern canyons
or the western edge of the region near Vain. Waystation has access to a
lot of iron veins and 40% [Copper](Copper.md "wikilink") nodes as well, and
satellite wreckage can be salvaged for iron closer to the southern edge
of the Border Zone. The same can be said about the Hub and Squin that
have iron and copper nodes in near proximity.

### Weather

*This zone has the Border Zone season. Seasons may cause harmful
[Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") or be purely aesthetic.*

- Sand steam (Duststorm)
- Desert dust swirls
- Sand steam (no effect)
- Desert calm

## Trivia

- Being the default starting zone for the most default starting
  scenario, this zone is arguably the most mild in dangers in all of
  Kenshi for a [](Nameless.md) to survive and learn the initial
  hardships of Kenshi for several reasons.
  - The [Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") are mild (unlike
    [Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink"), [](The_Black_Desert.md) or even
    [Venge](Venge.md "wikilink")).
  - The roaming [Dust Bandit](Dust_Bandit.md "wikilink") groups aren't
    skilled, (frankly besides [](Starving_Bandits.md) (and
    [the](Rebel_Farmers.md "wikilink") [like](Starving_Vagrant.md "wikilink"))
    [all](Sand_Ninjas.md "wikilink") [other](Bloodraiders.md "wikilink")
    [roaming](Swamp_Ninjas.md "wikilink")
    [bandit](Grass_Pirates.md "wikilink")
    [groups](Black_Desert_Ninjas.md "wikilink")
    [are](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink") [at](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md "wikilink")
    [least](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md "wikilink") [slightly](Scavengers.md "wikilink")
    [more](Red_Sabres.md "wikilink") [skilled](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink")
    [than](Skin_Bandits.md "wikilink") [them](Skeleton_Bandits.md "wikilink"))
    and there aren't hordes of mobs to overrun your group to [](Fishman_Island.md), [](Skinner's_Roam.md), or better yet,
    [eat](Fog_Islands.md "wikilink") [you](Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink")
    [up](Darkfinger.md "wikilink") [entirely](Royal_Valley.md "wikilink").
  - You won't be the subject of [opportunistic](Manhunters.md "wikilink")
    [enslavement](Slave_Hunters.md "wikilink"), and if you do get beaten
    down and are about to die from it, chances are you will be saved,
    and slaved by some [passers-by](Slavemonger.md "wikilink") to give you
    a [second chance at life](Slavery.md "wikilink").
  - The [Fauna](Fauna.md "wikilink") are non-challenging, both easy to
    defeat and easy to run away from, and they do not come in large
    numbers (or hide in the sand for ambush like
    [some](Skimmer.md "wikilink")). Set the foot slightly outside this zone
    to the western [Vain](Vain.md "wikilink") or the southern
    [Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink") and the threat increases
    significantly, with [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") and [](Blood_Spider.md) able to incapacitate any
    non-skilled combatant with ease and feast upon them when they are
    unconcious (with the former being so fast in speed that running away
    is hardly a possibility). And even then, these zones are nothing
    compared to the sheer amount of Fauna seen in (based on roughly
    escalating order of threats) [](Leviathan_Coast.md), [](The_Unwanted_Zone.md), [Gut](Gut.md "wikilink"),
    [Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink") and [Arach](Arach.md "wikilink").
  - Being a desolated no-mans-land, you won't really find yourself
    caught in conflict with any of the major factions with their dogma
    and way of life. Which can range anywhere from [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) - [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) to [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) each
    bringing [their](Prayer_Day.md "wikilink")
    [own](Tax_Collector.md "wikilink") [agendas](Tribute_Round.md "wikilink")
    to shove it down your throat. The only instance of interacting with
    them is when you settle down in the middle of the zone, which causes
    both HN and SK to come, but they usually beat each other up first
    due to their [own](The_Holy_Crusade.md "wikilink")
    [issues](King_Shager's_Reign.md "wikilink") with one another before
    they get to the player.
  - Outside of being knocked out dead, players will not really lose
    characters as a result of getting into places they are not supposed
    to be in without sufficient preparations. [](Dust_King_Tower.md) for one, will simply throw the
    player out once they get knocked out, giving them a chance to live
    another day. Meanwhilst, places like
    [Deadcat](Cannibal_Capital.md "wikilink"), [](Horrible_Ruin.md) and [](Preacher_Cult.md) simply kill off the character for
    good (and generally, most types of [](Ancient_Ruins.md) have dangers that can kill off an
    ill-prepared group).
  - There are a reasonable amounts of settlements to trade here, Squin,
    Waystation, The Hub and [](Rebel_Base.md) are all good places to trade provided
    you aren't enemies with any of them. Scavenging bodies, stealing or
    mining ores are all good ways to start off the budget.

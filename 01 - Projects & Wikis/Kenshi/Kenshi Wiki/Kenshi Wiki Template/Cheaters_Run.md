this region.

## Trivia

- The name of this zone could be aptly named for adventurers wishing to
  cross to [Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink") without going through the
  risks of through the [Royal Valley](Royal_Valley.md "wikilink") nor the
  [Sniper Valley](Sniper_Valley.md "wikilink"), as this zone is relatively
  safe and easy to traverse compared to other routes and methods to get
  to the Ashlands.

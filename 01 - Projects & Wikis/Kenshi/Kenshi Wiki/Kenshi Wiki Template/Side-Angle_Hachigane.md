The **Side-Angle Hachigane** is a Light Armour that is equipped in the
Headgear slot. It can be sold in UC Armour and Hat shops, as well as
Ronin Hat Shops. This headgear is exclusive to
[Humans](Human.md "wikilink").

It can be randomly worn by human [Anti-Slavers](Anti-Slaver.md "wikilink"),
[Anti-Slaver Jonins](Anti-Slaver_Jonin.md "wikilink"), [](Anti-Slaver_(unarmed).md),
[Drifters](Drifter.md "wikilink"), [](Grass_Pirate.md), [Mercenaries](Mercenary.md "wikilink"),
[Mercenary Heavies](Mercenary_Heavy.md "wikilink"), [](Straw_Lieutenant.md), [](Tech_Hunter.md), [](Tech_Hunter_Gate_Guard.md), [](Tech_Hunter_Guard.md), and [](Tech_Hunter_Ruins.md).

Of all light armour class headgear available, this item provides the
most protection, but it has a low head coverage and it the only piece of
armour in that category which needs a [](Heavy_Armour_Smithy.md) in order to craft it.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **3x3**.

## Appearance

The Side-Angle Hachigane is a metal plate attached to a grey bandana.
The metal plate is positioned so that the 'predicted' blow would land
along the right side of the character's skull.

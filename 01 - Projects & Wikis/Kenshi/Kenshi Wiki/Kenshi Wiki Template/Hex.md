**Hex** is an [Outlaw](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Outlaw.md "wikilink") being held prisoner in
[Tengu's Vault](Tengu's_Vault.md "wikilink"). She has a 25,000 Cats
[Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink"). She has the Brave
[Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

If you break her out of prison, she'll run away to check on her family
at the farm. This gives her the job "Wandering Trader" and has her run
around the United Cities forever, as there is no actual farm to return
to.

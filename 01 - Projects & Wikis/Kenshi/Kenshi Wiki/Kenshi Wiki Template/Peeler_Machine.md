This **nasty machine** is something the player should avoid. Owned by
the [Skin Bandits](Skin_Bandits.md "wikilink"), they will use it to skin
alive [Humans](Human.md "wikilink") that they have captured and taken to
one of their [Skinhouses](Skinhouse.md "wikilink").

Aside from damaging the character inside of it, the Peeler Machine
functions exactly like a [Prisoner Cage](Prisoner_Cage.md "wikilink"). This
means that placing any characters into them will count as imprisoning
them, and any effects for imprisoning a character in a [](Prisoner_Cage.md) (such as faction relationship changes)
will also occur. However, if a character of any
[faction](Factions.md "wikilink") dies in a peeler machine, faction
relations will not be affected any further. The Peeler Machine also
produces an [Animal Skin](Animal_Skin.md "wikilink") (somehow even from
skeletons).

The Peeler Machine works through 3 stages of its victim before it
becomes inactive, if there are any accessories that are being worn on
the character, they would be destroyed by the peeler over time, after
which the peeler will continue to deal cut damage to the victim's limbs.
Once all limbs have fallen below 0 health it begins to deal damage to
the characters vitals. It does not require the victim to be alive for
this machine to work.

As of update 0.99.5 (experimental) it is possible to acquire the
blueprint of this from [Savant](Savant.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- There is a known issue that, when putting a
  [Thrall](Thrall.md "wikilink") in a Peeler Machine, your game will crash
  to desktop. This is due to an unintended bug where the game cannot
  detect the head anatomy part that is present with all other
  characters. The mod, [Thrall Injury and Peeler Machine
  Fix](https://www.nexusmods.com/kenshi/mods/857), resolves this issue.
- Running into a player owned peeler machine will sometimes cause your
  character to take damage as if they were inside the machine itself.
  This can cause your armour to be destroyed if you react too slowly.
  This continues until your legs are crippled.
- Rarely sometimes characters are able to repair/bandage themselves and
  even attack you while inside a peeler.
- Characters can still be damaged by attacks while inside a Peeler
  machine. If you attack another character and your attack connects with
  the unit inside the peeler machine they will be hit as well.
- This machine could oddly operate on it's own without the need of
  electricity.
- In the final stage of peeling, when a character has reached a point
  that their texture is altered to show only muscular tissue, peeled
  characters may no longer be able to be picked up or looted. This is a
  minor bug, and these bodies will eventually despawn. The peeler will
  show their body within itself, but continue to function normally for
  subsequent characters.
- Skeletons have a different dialogue pack when they are being peeled.
  Instead of screaming, they will just mope on about how their parts are
  being damaged with lines such as "Nooo...", "No, don't-- \*crack\*"
  and "No, that's my-- \*snap\*"

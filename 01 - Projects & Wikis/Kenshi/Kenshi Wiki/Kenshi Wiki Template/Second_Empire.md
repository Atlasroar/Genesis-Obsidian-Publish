The **Second Empire** was formed by [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink")
after the collapse of the [Old Empire](Old_Empire.md "wikilink"), located
in the modern-day [Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink").

They had a prominent military order known as the [](Hydraulic_Knight.md), led by [](General_Jang.md). They also had a highly-skilled
[police](Old_Empire_Police_Captain.md "wikilink") force.

Around a few hundred years before the events of Kenshi, the Second
Empire collapsed, with the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink")
becoming the next iteration of the Empire (implied to be through a
rebellion). The remnants of the Second Empire became known as the
[Second Empire Exiles](Second_Empire_Exile.md "wikilink"), led by one of
the fallen Empire's founders, [Cat-Lon](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink"), whose
sanity was severely compromised over the years.

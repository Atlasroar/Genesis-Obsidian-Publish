**Old Empire Supply Outpost** is a building full of random supplies,
similar to a general store in a town, containing all types of resources
necessary for an outpost. Pieces of armour and weapons can also be found
here spawned in through the [Artifact system](Artifacts.md "wikilink"), as
well as large amounts of medical supplies. This location is also the
only source for the food item [](Ancient_Nutri-Rations.md). Several bedrolls
inside the outpost can provide an injured party a safe place to rest.

There may be a [Security Spider II](Security_Spider_II.md "wikilink")
present, which will attack you on sight.

**General Storage Boxes** are a basic [Storage](Storage.md "wikilink")
container.

Players can construct this building after researchingÂ [](Item_Storage_(Tech).md). It has the same storage
capacity as a [General Storage Chest](General_Storage_Chest.md "wikilink")
and requires more space, making it a less attractive option unless the
appearance is preferred.

### Info

- grid size 18x18
- stacking storage

##### NOTE: Characters will not pick up food from the container when they are hungry. \[V 0.93.5\]

**United Cities Reinforcements** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that
will trigger in response to the [Holy Assault](Holy_Assault.md "wikilink"),
[](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Inquisitor).md), [](Jonin_Assault.md), [](Retribution_of_God.md), and [](Wrath_of_God.md) events, as long as the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") is an ally of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) and [](Emperor_Tengu.md) is alive and free, and the player is
NOT an ally of the [Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink"), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), or [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

Once triggered the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") will send
reinforcements from the location they own closest to the player's
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"). While they will move
faster than most hostile events, they can still arrive too late if the
player's base is closer to the hostile event's spawn location than to
the origin of the reinforcements. These reinforcements will consist of
1-2 squads, each made up of 1-4 [](Samurai_Conscript.md), 5-8
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), 1-3 [](Samurai_Scout.md), led by a [](Samurai_Sergeant.md).

Once the reinforcements arrive, they will give a short speech, and then
start patrolling the player's base, attacking hostiles, defending the
player's characters, and healing wounded allies.

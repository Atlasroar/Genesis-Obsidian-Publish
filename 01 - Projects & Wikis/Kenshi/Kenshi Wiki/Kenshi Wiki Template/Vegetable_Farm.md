A **Vegetable Farm** produces
[Greenfruit](Greenfruit.md "wikilink")[.](Greenfruit.md "wikilink") It can be
farmed most efficiently in areas with the Green
[Environment](Environment.md "wikilink"). Greenfruit can also be grown
inside an Arid or Swamp environment, as long as there is more than 0% of
Green environment there as well. This building requires no research in
order to construct it.

## Farm Info & Building Requirements

There are three different sizes of Vegetable Farm, Vegetable Farm S,
Vegetable Farm M, and Vegetable Farm L. Each level of Vegetable Farm can
be upgraded to the next without having to remove and replant the field.
You will, however, lose all growth progress on the current crop.

There are currently no building options for a Vegetable Farm XL.

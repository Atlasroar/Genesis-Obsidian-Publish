As of version 0.62.0 the [Manual Oil Drill](Manual_Oil_Drill.md "wikilink")
is currently not implemented in the base game. It is however possible to
access and build the [Manual Oil Drill](Manual_Oil_Drill.md "wikilink") by
using the in-game editor (Shift + F12). This building can be found under
the 'Mining' section of buildings.

Though currently not part of the game, it has been said that certain
building types like the Generator will require fuel in the future. The
[Manual Oil Drill](Manual_Oil_Drill.md "wikilink") will most likely be used
to draw up fuel or some other form of crude oil from the ground. Since
there is also an [Oil Drill](Oil_Drill.md "wikilink") this will most likely
be a character operated building.

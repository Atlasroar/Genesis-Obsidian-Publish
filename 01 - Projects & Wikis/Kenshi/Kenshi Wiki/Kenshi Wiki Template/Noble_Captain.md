**Noble Captains **are elite members of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md). Due to their title, it is unknown if
they are in fact low-ranking nobles themselves, or simply veteran [](Hooded_Empire_Noble_Guard.md).

Regardless, they can be found in [](Stormgap_Coast.md), [](The_Great_Desert.md), and [](The_Hook.md), leading the entourage of [](Noble_Hunter.md), shooting down any in their path. 

If a character gets too close and stops moving, the captains will
consider them as terrorists and attack, if the Noble Hunter hasn't
already attacked them first.

Despite holding an arguably more important position within the UC's
hierarchy, Noble Captains are not as well equipped as [](Samurai_Captain.md) (with a 5% less chance of being
equipped with better gear), though they are equally skilled in combat.

**Doctors**of the [Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") can be found
in hospitals at the southern [](Holy_Military_Base.md) and [](Okran's_Shield.md), working alongside
[Surgeons](Surgeon.md "wikilink"). They tend to any wounded soldier of Holy
Nation nearby.

Unlike the Surgeons, the Doctors do not appear to offer any services to
the player.

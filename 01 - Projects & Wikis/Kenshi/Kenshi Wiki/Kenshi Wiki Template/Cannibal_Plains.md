Located in the North West of the map, the **Cannibal Plains** are
characterized by the large presence of
[Cannibals](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink"), as well as some [](Shrieking_Bandits.md) and
[Berserkers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink") mixed in the fight. [](Cannibal_Hunters.md) sometimes come here to hunt the
Cannibals.

Players can easily be overwhelmed by cannibals as they spawn in very
large numbers.

## Tips

- This area can be dangerous to traverse, as being swarmed by 40+
  enemies is very possible. If traveling through this regions, players
  should consider bringing either large squads or well-trained,
  well-geared characters.
- Avoid sleeping on camp beds in open area without guards, as Cannibals
  can easily pick up player characters who are sleeping and they cannot
  break free.

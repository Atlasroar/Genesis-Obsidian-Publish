**Dreg** is a zone to the West of the [](Fog_Islands.md) and South-East of [](Raptor_Island_(Zone).md).
[Prospecting](Prospecting.md "wikilink") reveals the area to be "dead",
although it is populated by sparse trees and shrubs. Low quality
[Copper](Copper.md "wikilink") can be mined here, although mid quality
[iron](Iron_Ore.md "wikilink") in the form of giant structures are also
found. The "Hive Exile" [game start](Game_Starts.md "wikilink") happens
here.

This area is inhabited by [Nomads](Nomads.md "wikilink"),
[Deadcat](Deadcat.md "wikilink") and [](Western_Hive.md).

Some groups of [Holy Nation Outlaws](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md "wikilink"),
[Starving Bandits](Starving_Bandits.md "wikilink"),
[Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") and even [Cannibals](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink")
who drifted too far away can be occasionally found here.

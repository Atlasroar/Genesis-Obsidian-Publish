The **Drowned Ruins** are housed in the crumbling remains of a long
forgotten settlement, the lost [Second Empire](Second_Empire.md "wikilink")
town of Catch,[^1] located midway up the river that separates
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") from the [](Hidden_Forest.md).

Though half sunken into the water, the ruins of Catch are not altogether
abandoned. A sole skeleton merchant who refers to himself as the [](Armor_King.md) makes his home in the Drowned Ruins along
with his royal guard, a [Security Spider](Security_Spider.md "wikilink")
and three of his own personal
[Thralls](Armour_King's_Thrall.md "wikilink").

Details on the Armour King's merchandise can be found on [](Armour_King's_Shop.md). Unlike all other Armour Shops,
beds can be rented upstairs for free. The existence of regular beds
instead of Skeleton Repair Beds only creates questions.

## Tips

- The only way to reach the location is by swimming up or down the
  river, entering either from the south side near [](Blister_Hill.md) or the west side near the
  [Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink").
- Considering how incredibly slow swimming is, it is recommended to send
  a [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") to this shop because skeletons do
  not need to swim.
- It's not recommended to steal from this shop because all of the NPCs
  have combat stats past 90 (and you should respect the Armour King.)

## Trivia

- According to Armour King, his shop has been running for 937 years[^2].
  Meaning that this ruin is likely to be older than that period.

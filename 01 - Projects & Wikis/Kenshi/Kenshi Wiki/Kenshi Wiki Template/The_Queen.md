**The Queen** is leader of the [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink")
and has [Diplomatic Status](Diplomatic_Status.md "wikilink"). She rules her
domain from the "Hill Hut" in the [](Western_Hive_(Location).md), located on an island west of
[Vain](Vain.md "wikilink").

Upon entering the Hill Hut, multiple [](Royal_Soldier_Drone.md) will gasp and walk over to you
and demand you leave. They do not become hostile if you refuse. The Hive
Queen can be seen sitting atop a strange throne and only communicates
through screeches.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

The world states affected by the Queen are linked to her being either
dead or kidnapped.

If **The Queen** has been killed or kidnapped, then [](Lost_Hiver.md) can be found in cities talking about how
they miss The Queen. Also, the [Hive Villages](Hive_Village.md "wikilink")
and [Distant Hive Villages](Distant_Hive_Village.md "wikilink") will be
[overtaken](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") by [Fogmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink")
and become [Deadhive Overruns](Deadhive_Overrun.md "wikilink").

If the Queen has been killed or kidnapped, a [Hive
Attack](Hive_Attack "wikilink") will commence on the players base not
long after in order to avenge the queen.

If The Queen has been killed or kidnapped, [](Fog_Deathyard.md) will start spawning in
[Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink"), [Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink") and
[Vain](Vain.md "wikilink").

If The Queen has been killed or kidnapped, then [](Hive_Bandit.md) (lead by [](Hive_Bandit_Leader.md)), [](Lost_Hiver.md) and [](Lost_Prince.md) will start to spawn in [](Border_Zone.md), [Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink"), [](Flats_Lagoon.md), [](Okran's_Pride.md), [](Okran's_Valley.md), [Sinkuun](Sinkuun.md "wikilink"),
[Skinner's Roam](Skinner's_Roam.md "wikilink"), [](Stenn_Desert.md), [The Eye](The_Eye.md "wikilink"), [](The_Great_Desert.md), and [](The_Swamp.md). **Lost Hivers** will start spawning in
[Purple Sands](Purple_Sands.md "wikilink") as well.

If The Queen has been killed or kidnapped, the [](Farm_Trader.md) and the [](Materials_Trader.md) events will no longer occur and a
[Hive Attack](Hive_Attack_(Western_Hive).md "wikilink") event will trigger.

If the Queen of the Western Hive is dead and [](Queen_of_the_South.md) is alive and not kidnapped, then
Southern Hive patrols will spawn in
the [Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink"), [](Border_Zone.md), [](Flats_Lagoon.md), [](Okran's_Gulf.md), [](Okran's_Pride.md), [The Hook](The_Hook.md "wikilink"), [](The_Swamp.md) and in [Vain](Vain.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- Despite being the leader of the Western Hive, who are heavily disliked
  by [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"), she does not appear
  to have a bounty by [Holy Lord Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink")
  or the [Inquisitors](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"). It is especially strange
  because her existence is known to the Holy Nation as referenced in the
  book [Guiding Light VI](The_Guiding_Light_Series.md "wikilink").
- [The Queen](The_Queen.md "wikilink") has the exact same stats of their
  Southern Cousin Queen, [](Queen_of_the_South.md)

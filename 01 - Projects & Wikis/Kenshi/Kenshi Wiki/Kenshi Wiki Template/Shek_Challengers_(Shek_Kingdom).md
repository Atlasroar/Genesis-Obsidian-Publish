**Shek Challengers** is an event that can trigger if you defeat any of
the following events, [Enemy Hunt](Enemy_Hunt.md "wikilink"), [](Return_For_Blood.md), [](Return_For_Tribute.md), [](Shek_Revenge.md), or [](Tribute_Round.md). It also requires that
[Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink"), [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md), [Seto](Seto.md "wikilink"),
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"), and the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) to all not be killed or captured.
If even one of them has been, the raid will fail to trigger. It will
also fail to trigger if the player is allied to the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

Once the conditions are met, the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink")
will launch an assault on the player's base. This assault will consist
of 3-4 squads, each made up of 5-8 [](Shek_Warrior.md) and 0-1 [](Shek_Scout.md), led by an additional [](Shek_Warrior.md).

Once the assault arrives, the war leader will make a short speech about
how they want to fight you, and then the assault will start attacking
the player's gates and characters. If victorious, the assault will leave
shortly after, and a [Return For Tribute](Return_For_Tribute.md "wikilink")
event will trigger almost instantly. If defeated, the [](Shek_Revenge.md) event will trigger in 72-150 hours.

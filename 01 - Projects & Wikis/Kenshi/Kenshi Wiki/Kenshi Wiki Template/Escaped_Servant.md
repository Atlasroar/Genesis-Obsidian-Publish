**Escaped Servants** are members of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md). As their name implies, they
are [Holy Servants](Holy_Servant.md "wikilink") and/or [](Lower_Servant.md) who have escaped the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md).

They spawn in groups of 1 to 8. They can spawn in the [](Border_Zone.md), [](Cannibal_Plains.md), [Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink"), [](Fog_Islands.md), [](Okran's_Gulf.md), [](Okran's_Pride.md), [](Okran's_Valley.md), [](Skinner's_Roam.md), and [Vain](Vain.md "wikilink").

An Escaped Servant will likely attack any nearby squad, although less
likely compared to a [Hungry Bandit](Hungry_Bandit.md "wikilink"). If they
find unconscious characters, they search them and loot any
[Food](Food.md "wikilink") items.

## Interactions

An **Escaped Servant**, if alone in the squad and is wounded, can
initiate dialogue with the player nearby. Selecting the right choices
will allow the player to recruit them.

## Trivia

- Holy Nation Outlaws were introduced in the v0.90 beta update.

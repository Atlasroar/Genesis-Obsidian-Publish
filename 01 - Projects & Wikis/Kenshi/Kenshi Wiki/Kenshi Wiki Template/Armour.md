![](Armour_Graphic2.png "Armour_Graphic2.png")
[Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") is a selection of equipment worn on various
parts of the body to mitigate damage. It can be worn on five different
parts of the body. Armour can be made by the player through the skill
[Armour Smith](Armour_Smith.md "wikilink"), purchased from
[Traders](Armour_&_Clothing_Shops.md "wikilink"), or looted from
characters. All types of armour are most efficiently stored in [](Armour_Storage.md) (but can also be stored in general
storage). For the Armour **category** please see [this
page](:Category:Armour "wikilink").

## Types of Armour

Kenshi categorizes Armour into four different categories, depending on
damage resistance and skill multipliers.

### Clothing

[Clothing](Clothing.md "wikilink") is equipment which does not have armour
coverage. Clothing is generally worn by civilians. Wearing clothing can
be advantageous for keeping a character's "looks like a slave" rating
low when escaping from [Slavery](Slavery.md "wikilink"). Some clothing has
bonuses specifically for [Martial Arts](Martial_Arts.md "wikilink").

### Light Armour

[Light Armour](Light_Armour.md "wikilink") is likely to have bonuses to
Combat [Stats](Statistics.md "wikilink"). Light armour is preferred by
players who want to prioritize bonus attack, defense, dodge, and
attack/block speeds of their characters. Afterall, who needs protection
when your enemy doesn't get a chance to attack?

### Medium Armour

[Medium Armour](Medium_Armour.md "wikilink") offers more coverage than
light armour and less resistances than heavy armour, but without the
latter's severe skill penalties.

### Heavy Armour

[Heavy Armour](Heavy_Armour.md "wikilink") is armour which weighs a lot.
Heavy Armour offers the most damage resistances, but also has negative
effects on stats. The penalties caused by this type of armour make
battles more difficult and therefore allow characters to level up faster
in combat stats. (Attack, Defense, Dodge, Martial Arts, Dexterity)

This armour is favored by high level military members and tanks. Because
heavier armour is likely to have penalties to
[Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"), characters using cutting weapons
should avoid it unless training.

## Mechanics

To learn more about how the stats on certain equipment will affect your
characters in battle, read our page on
[Resistances](Resistances.md "wikilink") and our [](Guide_to_Equipment.md).

To learn how those stats are calculated from equipment parameters set in
FCS, read [Armor Stats](Armor_Stats.md "wikilink").

### [Colour Scheme](Colour_Scheme.md "wikilink")

Some types of armour can have a colour variance, mostly dependent on the
faction that wears it. Armour with these colour variations can be
obtained through looting characters from these factions.

You can remove the color of dyed armour by selling it to a vendor,
closing the shop and purchasing it back. Please note that Armour sells
for 0.25x of its value so by doing so you will be paying 0.75x of the
price to simply remove the dye.

## [Faction uniforms](Faction_Uniform.md "wikilink")

A Faction Uniform is armour that some [Factions](Factions.md "wikilink")
members may wear. An [Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") is considered a Faction
Uniform if the clothing is tagged as being a uniform of a set faction.
Player Characters wearing Faction Uniforms will be considered "[](Disguise.md)" and may be arrested by police for
[Uniform Theft](Bounty.md "wikilink").

Your characters may be allowed to wear a Faction Uniform if you are
allied with that particular faction. Note that factions which are
hostile to the faction you are wearing the uniform of may also attack
you, mistaking you for their enemy.

You can remove a faction uniform by knocking out (Assassination) a
recruitable character like a Drifter and making them wear the uniform.
They MUST be wearing it. After that wait for them to wake back up and
recruit them. This will remove the Faction Uniform tag. (If the
character is hostile with you as you were caught KOing them wait around
5 game hours and they should return to neutral, or leave and come back
later. __NOTOC__ __NOEDITSECTION__

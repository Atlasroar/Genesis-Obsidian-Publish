There are two locations called **Fishing Village** in Kenshi.

There is one Fishing Village North of [](World's_End.md) in [](Northern_Coast.md) which is a quaint town with piers and
shacks by the sea side. The town is owned by the
[Deadcat](Deadcat.md "wikilink") faction. Small herds of
[goats](Goat.md "wikilink") can usually be found nearby. Residents complain
of nearby [Cannibals](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink"). [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) can often be found in the nearby
area. The town contains a bar as well as a general item trader shop and
a fish salesmen.

The other Fishing Village is walled village in [](The_Outlands.md) East of [](Black_Scratch.md). It is also owned by the
[Deadcat](Deadcat.md "wikilink") faction. This town is threatened by [](Grass_Pirates.md) and [Reavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink").
The only service this town contains is a [Bar](Bar.md "wikilink").

[Green Finger](Green_Finger.md "wikilink"), [Hobbs](Hobbs.md "wikilink"),
[Horse](Horse.md "wikilink") and [Soman](Soman.md "wikilink") could be
recruited in a fishing village.

## Town overrides

Both towns will be [taken over](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") by the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) if [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") is
killed ([](Fishing_Village,_Slave_Traders.md)).

## Trivia

- There appears to be an override bug with the The Outlands Fishing
  Village, as technically it is supposed to belong to the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) faction according to it's FCS data.
  The mod, **[Fixed Fishing
  Village](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2348787545)**,
  resolves this issue.

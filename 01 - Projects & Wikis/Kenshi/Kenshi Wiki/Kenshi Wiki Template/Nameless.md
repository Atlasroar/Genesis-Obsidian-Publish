**Nameless** is the player's controlled [Faction](Faction.md "wikilink").
Although literally without a name, it can be renamed at any time by
going to the "Faction" menu and clicking on "Faction Name". The Nameless
is a completely player-based faction. There are no preset squads,
faction relations, or gear belonging to it unless the player's choice of
[Game Start](Game_Starts.md "wikilink") determines so.

Player's faction name appears on weaponry and armor crafted by a
playable character, for example "This [](Horse_Chopper.md) was crafted by [Red](Red.md "wikilink")
of Nameless". With the use of a [](Plastic_Surgeon.md) and faction renaming, this feature
can be used to create short "notes" within a game. For example, it is
possible to create "Uniform of Archers" tag on an armor item by using
this technique. In this case "Uniform" is the temporary name of the
player's faction and "Archers" is a renamed character, author of the
item. Both temporary names can be reverted back once the production
cycle is over.

## Lock complexity

Lock complexity is the level of the lock on player-made structures, like
[Cages](Prisoner_Cage.md "wikilink") and locked doors on player-owned
[Buildings](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") and player-made
[Gates](Defensive_Gates.md "wikilink").

- Cages - 60
- Containers - 60
- Doors - 75
- Lock Randomization - 0

## Relations

### Faction Relations

*The reasons for this faction to have special relations towards others.*

- The [Son of a Captain](Game_Starts.md "wikilink") start will cause the
  Nameless faction to have +100 relations with the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), at the cost of -100 relations with
  [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink").
- [The Wandering Trader](Game_Starts.md "wikilink") start grants +75
  relations with the [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink").
- [The Holy Sword](Game_Starts.md "wikilink") start grants -100 relations
  with [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") & [](Imperial_Lords.md). However Imperial lords are not
  actually a faction which is used in game, so their reduced relations
  do not matter.
- The [Holy Nation Citizen](Game_Starts.md "wikilink") start grants +15
  relations with [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink").

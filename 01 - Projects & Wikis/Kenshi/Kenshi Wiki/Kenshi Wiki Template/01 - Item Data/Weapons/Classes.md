Different weapons deal [Damage](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Weapons/Damage.md "wikilink") in different ways.

#### [Blunt Weapons](Blunt_Weapons.md "wikilink")

> [Blunt Weapons](Blunt_Weapons.md "wikilink") primarily deal stun damage,
> which does not require a first aid kit to heal.

#### [Hackers](Hackers.md "wikilink")

> [Hackers](Hackers.md "wikilink") are weapons which balance cutting and
> stun damage. Hackers deal additional damage against
> [Robots](Robots.md "wikilink"), and have impressive armour penetration.
> Their drawback is that they are slightly less effective against
> [Animals](:Category:Animals "wikilink").

#### [Heavy Weapons](Heavy_Weapons.md "wikilink")

> [Heavy Weapons](Heavy_Weapons.md "wikilink") are weapons which require
> large amounts of strength to properly wield, but reward the user with
> the ability to deal large amounts of damage in a wide arc.

#### [Katanas](Katanas.md "wikilink")

> [Katanas](Katanas.md "wikilink") are weapons which specialize cutting
> damage. They have a unique double attack animation which can give them
> an edge in 1v1 fights. They usually have bonus damage against humans
> at the cost of being weak against armour and robots.

#### [Polearms](Polearms.md "wikilink")

> [Polearms](Polearms.md "wikilink") are long weapons which are very light.
> They usually deal additional damage against animals. Their drawback is
> their penalties when used indoors.

#### [Sabres](Sabres.md "wikilink")

> [Sabres](Sabres.md "wikilink") are weapons which deal both types of
> damage, however they are more centered around cutting damage.

### Manufacturers

Weapon quality is determined by the manufacturer. Shown below are the
manufacturers, along with their weapon models.

- [Unknown](Unknown_(manufacturer).md "wikilink"): This weapon is probably
  a few hundred years old, any indentifiable markings have long since
  rusted away.
  -

  -
- [Ancient](Ancient_(Manufacturer).md "wikilink"): This weapon dates back
  to the old empire.  It's not great, but it says something that it has
  lasted this long.  It's been re-fitted and sharpened in recent times,
  and still holds a good edge.
  -

  -

  -
- [Catun Scrapmaster](Catun_Scrapmaster_(Manufacturer).md "wikilink"): The
  Catun Scrapmasters are probably the only major smithing group
  producing weapons in the modern age.  Their blades are good quality
  and used all over the continent.
  -

  -

  -
- [Skeleton Smiths](Skeleton_Smiths_(Manufacturer).md "wikilink"):
  Skeletons from the Black Desert City produce blades solely for
  personal use, however it's inevitable that some eventually end up in
  circulation.
  -

  -

  -
- [Edgewalkers](Edgewalkers.md "wikilink"): The Edgewalkers were a group of
  smiths from the old fallen empire hundreds of years ago.  Little is
  known about them except that their weapons have survived these
  hundreds of years in near-perfect condition and their quality is
  unrivalled by anything crafted in the modern age.
  -

  -

  -
- [Cross](Cross.md "wikilink"): There was at some point in history a
  legendary master smith, of whom nothing is known except his (...her?)
  name from the blade inscriptions: "Cross".  The blades never rust or
  need sharpening, and are said to be unbreakable.  There are only a
  handful in existence.
  -
- [Homemade](Homemade.md "wikilink"), the playermade weapons.
  - All models included, except for [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") and
    [Edge Type 3](Edgewalkers.md "wikilink").

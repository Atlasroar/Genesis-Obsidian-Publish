![](Surgeon.jpg "Surgeon.jpg")![](Surgeon.jpg "Surgeon.jpg") **Plastic
Surgeons** are NPCs who have a chance of spawning at any
[bars](Bar.md "wikilink"). In exchange for 200 cats, the character editor
will be re-activated, allowing the player to make changes to existing
character including a new name.

There is a similar NPC named [](Guild_Plastic_Surgeon.md) found at [](Shinobi_Thieves.md) towers, who will provide the
service for free, but only to members of the guild.

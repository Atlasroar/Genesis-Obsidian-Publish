**Holy Military Bases**are small outposts controlled by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). There are two bases, both located
in [Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink"). Both of them can be placed
on your world map by reading the **Glorious Holy
[Map](Maps.md "wikilink")**.

Judging by how close these **Holy Military Bases** are with the [](Fog_Islands.md), and how [](World_States.md) show that when these military bases
collapses they become overrun by [Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") alongside
with [Fogman Nest Invasion](Fog_Deathyard.md "wikilink") starting at
Okran's Gulf, it is highly likely that these military bases were built
to fortify the defensive position against the Fogmen.

Most of the structures inside them are Barracks and
[Armouries](Holy_Armory.md "wikilink"). However, the Southern Military base
has buildings that provide services such as: Holy Bakery, Hospital and
Holy Armory.

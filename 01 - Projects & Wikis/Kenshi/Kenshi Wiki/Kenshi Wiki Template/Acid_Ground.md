**Acid Ground** is a trait of some [Zones](:Category:Zones "wikilink")
where there has been heavy pollution. This pollution has led to the
ground becoming acidic. This acidity can harm the feet of characters,
causing [Blunt Damage](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Damage.md "wikilink") to Legs. This trait has no
effect
on [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink") or [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") characters,
as they are immune to all forms of Acid. This also has no effect
on [Robot Limbs](Robot_Limbs.md "wikilink").

[Human](Human.md "wikilink") and [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") characters can
easily be protected from this by wearing any type
of [Footwear](Footwear.md "wikilink").

**Dodge** is used in [unarmed combat](Martial_Arts.md "wikilink") and when
stumbling. Equipping a weapon will cause characters to block incoming
hits instead of dodging them. A character equipped with a weapon will
only attempt to dodge when they are attacked while stumbling.

The chance of dodging is calculated similarly to the chance of blocking.
It has a maximum 95% chance when your dodging level is at least 21
levels higher than your opponent's attack level. Having additional
levels does not provide any additional benefits, but it may be useful
against more skilled opponents.

## Â Training

As with Melee Fighting skills, the XP rate of Martial Arts and Dodge is
connected to whether a character is fighting someone who is better
trained than them, according to [](Stronger_Opponent_Logic.md). Wearing
[Equipment](Equipment.md "wikilink") which increases Dodge stats will
result in less stressful battles but much longer training time because
of this. The fastest way to train Dodge is to wear the best damage
reducing armour you can while not encumbering yourself, as well as a
[Backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") with a very high drain on combat stats
and then purposefully getting hit. Being hit grants at least double the
experience that dodging an attack does so this is the best way to level.
(Note that sometimes you'll get experience multiple times for being
hit... From testing this may be due to a character "failing" to dodge
and then registering that they can try to dodge again giving the
experience once more. Needs further testing though.)

## Features

Features list found on [Steam shop
page](https://store.steampowered.com/app/233860/Kenshi/).

- <strong>Freeform gameplay in a seamless game world</strong> in the
  largest single-player RPG world since Daggerfall, stretching over 870
  square kilometers. The game will never seek to limit you or restrict
  your personal play style.
- <strong>Custom design as many characters as you want </strong>and
  build up a whole squad to fight for you. Characters will grow and
  become stronger with experience, not just in their stats but their
  appearance too.
- <strong>Original take on the RTS-RPG hybrid genre.</strong> No "hero"
  characters with artificially stronger stats than everybody else- Every
  character and NPC you meet is potentially an equal, and has a name, a
  life.
- <strong>You are not the chosen one. </strong>You're not great and
  powerful. You don't have more 'hitpoints' than everyone else. You are
  not the center of the universe, and you are not special. Unless you
  work for it.
- <strong>Build a base</strong> where you can research new technologies,
  upgrade your defences and craft new gear.
- <strong>Purchase and upgrade your own buildings</strong> to use as
  safe fortified havens when things go bad, or use them to start up a
  business.
- <strong>Variation and possibilities of gameplay. </strong>Be good, be
  evil, be a businessman, be a thief, live in a town, live in the
  desert, travel alone, travel in hordes, build a fortress, raze a city.
  Devote yourself to freeing slaves, or maybe end up a slave yourself.
- <strong>Dynamic, ever changing world. </strong>Support or hinder
  whoever you wish, or keep to yourself, the world won't stop moving.
  This is not just a "game", you are living and surviving in a simulated
  world.
- <strong>Get captured by cannibals and eaten alive</strong>, or sold
  off by slavers and forced to work in the mines. These are not scripted
  events, just a regular part of this chaotic world that ruins your life
  by chance. Anything can happen, yet anything can be overcome if you
  have the strength.
- <strong>Absolutely no Level-scaling.</strong> The world does not level
  up along with you, and the shops don't change their inventory to only
  items matching your level. At the start of the game almost everyone
  will be stronger than you, and survival will always be a struggle. The
  game won't hold your hand or help you when you're down.
- <strong>Realistic medical system that affects gameplay.</strong> A
  character with a wounded leg will limp or crawl and slow the party
  down, wounded arms means you must use your sword one-handed or not at
  all. Severe injuries will result in amputees needing robotic limb
  replacements. Blood loss means you can pass out, and the blood will
  attract predators. A character’s stats are affected by equipment,
  encumbrance, blood loss, injuries and starvation.
- <strong>Intelligent AI</strong> that allows for characters to reason
  and work towards long-term goals and desires. Squads work together and
  carry their wounded to safety. Characters can be setup to take care of
  micromanagement for you and run production in your base.
- <strong>Aid or oppose the various factions</strong> in the world while
  striving for the strength and wealth necessary to simply survive in
  the harsh environment.
- <strong>Independently developed </strong>with no design influences, or
  alterations dictated by men in gray suits who have never played a game
  before in their lives.
- <strong>Original game world. </strong>There are no fantasy-knock-off
  cliches. No magic.

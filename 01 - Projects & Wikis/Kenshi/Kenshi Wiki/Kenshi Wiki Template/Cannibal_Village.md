A **Cannibal Village** is a [Minor Outpost](Minor_Outposts.md "wikilink")
created by [Cannibals](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") to serve as a staging
ground and rest area for their faction.

There are three Cannibal Villages in the [](Cannibal_Plains.md): one to the South-West of the
[Cannibal Capital](Cannibal_Capital.md "wikilink"), one to the South East
of the Cannibal Capital, and one the the West-South-West of the Cannibal
Capital. A fourth one will override [](Flotsam_Village.md) if [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") is dead.

There are two Cannibal Villages in [Darkfinger](Darkfinger.md "wikilink"),
as well as a named Cannibal Village: [](First_Village.md).

These villages primarily consist of tents, beds, makeshift metal shacks,
and prisoner cages. Multiple roaming squads of Cannibals are usually
resting in the village or patrolling nearby.

As [Shrieking Bandits](Shrieking_Bandits.md "wikilink") are commonly seen
skirmishing with the Cannibals, it is not uncommon to see the Cannibal's
prisoner cages filled with Shrieking Bandits.

A random Cannibal Village is a location for a 2 character "Cannibal
Hunters" [game start](Game_Starts.md "wikilink").

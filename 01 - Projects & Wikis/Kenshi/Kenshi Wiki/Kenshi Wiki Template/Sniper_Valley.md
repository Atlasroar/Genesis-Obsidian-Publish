**Sniper Valley** is a zone in the southeastern corner of the continent,
near the [Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink").

It's likely named after it's frequent presence of
[Sniperbots](Sniperbot.md "wikilink"). It's also notable for being one of
the few regions where [Leviathans](Leviathan.md "wikilink") may be present.

## Tips

- Player characters who run linearly or are idling may be shot by a
  nearby, unnoticed Sniperbot. It is recommended to either micromanage
  constantly, wear heavy armour to reduce damage or keep an eye out for
  any bots that may be nearby to prevent their characters from being
  severely injured.
- If an npc using a ranged weapon is not on screen they have extremely
  delayed attacks, and most times will not fire at all. By zooming in
  your camera and facing it down you can avoid sniper fire with ease. Be
  wary not to run facefirst into the Skin Bandits who roam to the south
  when doing so.

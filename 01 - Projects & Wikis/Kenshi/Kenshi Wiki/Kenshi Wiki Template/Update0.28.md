**Version 0.28** added recruitment mechanics to Kenshi.

No blog announcement was made for this patch.

__TOC__

## 0.28.0

- Bars now have a range of recruitable characters, a couple are unique,
  most are randomly generated. There will be a better range later once
  all the new character models have been made.
- Added a RESCUE button, next to the medic button. Selected characters
  will pickup their wounded allies and put them in a bed if any are
  available.
- Certain NPCs have unique names. The Indiegogo peoples names are now
  included.
- Fixed the Bodyguard behaviour. A character in Bodyguard mode will try
  to take the heat off their target by attacking his attackers, and
  staying close in battle. A good way to protect a new recruit.

#### FIXES

- Importing your squad to a new game now imports your faction relations
  too. Now you can't exploit it by robbing traders and importing to a
  new game to avoid the factions repurcussions. The traders guild is
  very sensitive.
- Fixed, or at least reduced, the bug where characters in defensive mode
  can get in a stalemate where nobody attacks.
- Fixed the missing Dust Bandits.

## 0.28.2

- Fixed dialogue choices sometimes having the wrong result
- Fixed new NPC names not being loaded
- Squad recruitment capped at 20 for now, to stop the GUI overflowing
- strength increases at half the speed (preparation for next update...)

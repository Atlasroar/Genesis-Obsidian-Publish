Combat is a part of Kenshi gameplay which should be highly anticipated.
However, there is more to remaining healthy in Kenshi than just
bandaging wounds. This **Guide to Health** should help newer users learn
all information regarding Hunger, Healing, Splints, and Limb
Replacement.

## Beds

Healing is slow, and it is recommended that characters rest in a
[Bed](Bed.md "wikilink") (8x Heal speed) or a [](Camp_Bed.md) (4x Heal speed) if they are injured. Beds and
Camp Beds can be rented at [Bars](Bar.md "wikilink") and occasionally used
for free at some locations. Camp Beds can easily be carried by
characters and built in buildings or in the wilderness in order to rest.

While sleeping in a Bed or Camp Bed, the hunger meter will decrease at
0.33x the normal rate. On top of that wounds will not degrade while
sleeping, this is even the case for Skeletons. However, any
unbandaged/unrepaired health will not heal no matter how long you wait.

## Hunger

Over time, characters get hungry. When a character's hunger meter goes
below 250, that character will eat whatever [Food](Food.md "wikilink") has
the lowest nutrition value in their inventory. A character will only eat
a maximum of 50 nutrition at one time. If a character's hunger drops
below 200, they will start to suffer from malnutrition and their stats
will begin to be negatively affected. If their hunger meter continues to
drop below 100, they will begin to pass out regularly from hunger. This
fainting will become more and more frequent as their hunger meter
steadily declines. Eventually, the character will die from starvation.
The hunger point at which you begin to faint is 100 - (KO Point). Your
KO point can be found by checking your Toughness in a characters stat
page or by expanding the UI at the bottom left side of the screen.

Each race has a modifier for rate of hunger. Skeletons do not need to
eat and, therefore, their hunger rate is 0.

Characters which are enslaved are kept fed to around 115, which results
in major stat drainage from malnutrition.

### Nutrition

Every edible food item has a clearly labeled Nutrition amount. If
characters have multiple of these items spread out among them, they can
be consolidated by moving them into the same inventory (only works if
they are not stolen items).

More complicated food items have the most Nutrition values, such as
[Foodcubes](Foodcube.md "wikilink"), [Gohan](Gohan.md "wikilink"), and [](Ration_Pack.md).

### Sharing Food

If working with many characters, it can be time consuming and tedious to
add food to each individual inventory. By purchasing a stacking
[Backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") and filling it with as many food items
as possible, the need for distributing food is mitigated. All Player
Characters in the same squad who are nearby the character wearing the
backpack filled with food will eat food out of it if their hunger is low
enough to trigger eating. If the player wants to avoid the negative
stats of wearing a backpack, they can easily remove the backpack from
the backpack slot and regularly put it on for a second in order to feed
all characters at once or use a [](Small_Thieves_Backpack.md). This technique will only
work if all characters are in the same squad. To feed members of another
squad a character with the backpack full of food should also exist in
another squad.

Domesticated Animal player characters will also eat out of another
player character's backpack, provided they are a part of the same squad.
Characters can also eat food from a livestock backpack which can be worn
on [Domesticated Bulls](Domesticated_Bull.md "wikilink") and [](Pack_Beast.md). More about animal player characters can
be found on [Guide to Animals](Guide_to_Animals.md "wikilink").

## Healing

Characters of all non-animal races will need to be bandaged/repaired if
they take cutting [Damage](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Damage.md "wikilink") during fights. Characters
will need the corresponding [Medical Item](Medical_Items.md "wikilink") for
their race. The other kind of damage is stun damage. It is received from
blunt damage, or from armour mitigating cut damage into stun through cut
resist and cut efficiency. This damage appears as lost limb health, and
regenerates without the need of a bandage.

The [Field Medic](Field_Medic.md "wikilink") skill governs the speed of
bandaging and how many charges you consume when using your medical
supplies, while the [Robotics](Robotics.md "wikilink") skill governs the
same but for robots/using robotic supplies. This is dependent on the
level of the first aid kit in use. Kits which are in a character's
inventory will be used before ones in a backpack. Kits which have the
least charges left will be used first (like how the person eats lower
quality food first). Using lower quality kits will allow a character to
level more while healing well as it limits the speed of the medic or
roboticist. Higher level skilled people will not only bandage/repair
faster, but they will also bandage/repair more with the same kit as they
use less charges.

### Bleeding and Triage

All characters have blood, although for Skeletons this is called "Oil."
The blood is the top line on the health pane. If you see arrows (\<)
over a character's blood then they are bleeding. The more arrows the
more bleeding. The amount of blood loss greatly increases as you
accumulate more bleeding. As losing a limb causes around 6-30 instant
blood loss no matter the bleed rate, Hivers (50 Blood) are very
vulnerable to being KOed from blood loss. Clotting occurs naturally
after taking damage, as you only bleed at the maximum rate for a few
seconds. Death from blood loss occurs when reaching your maximum blood
value as a negative. Examples are a Hiver reaching -50 blood, Skeleton
reaching -100 Oil, etc... The difficulty settings in the game settings
determine if limbs destroy themselves if they reach -100%. If your game
setting is limb loss=rare, then you can patch up the head, torso and
stomach quickly, and ignore the limbs, as any compounding cut damage on
the limbs will be non-fatal.

When a character has received at least 20 cut damage on a part of their
body it begins to degenerate, indicated by "\<". The wound will
degenerate based off the amount of cut damage in total on the part along
with character's Toughness level. If you have over 100% of your total
health as cut damage you will see, "\<\<" and the wound will worsen at a
MUCH faster rate. The speed appears to be x4 as fast as 90% of your
total health as cut damage. People die when those body parts reach below
-100% so it is very important to bandage cuts to avoid succumbing to
your wounds. A character will get knocked out when their vital (Head,
Chest or Stomach) body parts drop below 0 from damage in combat and will
enter a recovery coma when an injury goes under their KO Point (KO Point
= 10+([Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink"))0.75). The coma ends when their
vital health rises above 0. If a unit's blood level drops below 0, they
will also be knocked out. After being knocked out by reaching 0 blood,
you will only be knocked out again through bloodloss/bleeding upon
reaching -25 blood.

Races respond to bleeding damage at a different rate. Weapons have their
own Bloodloss values. For instance, a [Nodachi](Nodachi.md "wikilink") has
a Bloodloss of 1.2x which means it will deal 20% more bloodloss/bleeding
than a 1.0 Bloodloss weapon. Hivers and skeletons have low bleedrates
and as such are quite resistant to the bloodloss applied from weapons.

You will not regenerate blood until you stop bleeding. You recover blood
twice as fast when resting in any type of bed.

### Bandaging Cuts

![](BloodLimbLost.png "BloodLimbLost.png") Cut damage on humanoid
characters never heals by itself, unless using mods which add
self-healing to the race. Some characters can spawn with above the max
level of Toughness achievable by the player (Such as Estata/Eyegore)
which results in their wounds never degenerating and instead healing as
their Degeneration rate is in the negatives. However, without a bandage
their injuries will never heal the last 20 cut damage. Cut damage with
the "<big>\<</big>" sign means the injury is getting worse.

In order to bandage cuts, non-robotic characters must use a [](First_Aid_Kit.md). These items are easily found across
Kenshi as many non-player characters will be holding a Basic First Aid
Kit and they are often stocked in stores. Characters can use a First Aid
Kit while it is in their inventory or inside the backpack they are
wearing. A character will use whichever (Still follows the same lower
quality kits first rule) kit is first in their inventory, followed by
backpack. When applying first aid a unit's wounds will be bandaged from
top to bottom.

There are two methods for healing player characters. The first is to
right click on the wounded character. The mouse tooltip will become a
green plus (+) symbol when a hurt character is moused over. The wounded
character can heal themselves as long as they have not become
unconscious from their wounds. First Aid is also an option in the
right-click-hold menu for that character and selecting that will also
trigger the same action.

The second method is to click the Medic button in the [](Guide_to_UI_and_Controls.md). This will command the
currently selected character(s) to heal any other player characters
immediately nearby. When this button is shift-clicked, the job of Medic
is assigned to the selected character(s). This job can get your
characters into trouble when they have allies nearby to heal, as
characters will leave the "playing dead" stance, to perform that job. If
alone a character may bandage/repair themselves whilst playing dead.
(Due to a bug, sometimes Skeletons will not repair themselves when
playing dead. If you save the game while unconscious as a Skeleton, when
the game loads and the character begins to play dead they will repair
themselves as they should do normally)

### Repairing Robotics

When [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") or units with [](Robot_Limbs.md) take cutting damage it must be repaired
to heal. In order to conduct repairs, characters must be holding a
[](Medical_Items.md). These items are primarily found in
stores but can also be found through looting many Skeleton non-player
character or an [Ancient Lab](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink"). Characters can
use a Repair Kit while it is in their inventory or inside the backpack
they are wearing. You may also use a Skeleton Repair Bed to repair cut
injuries. If you wish to assign Robotics as a goal/job make sure to have
the Repair Kit in your inventory and not in a bag, then shift + right
click medic at the bottom right. After assigning it a goal/job you can
put the Repair Kits in your bag like normal.

The methods for repairing [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") characters and
Robot Limbs are the same as the methods for First Aid, except the name
for the action is Repairs in the right-click-hold menu.

Robotic health which is repaired (cut damage) will heal at 250x the
normal rate. (So 250xhealrate)

Whenever a robotic body part receives damage the maximum health of that
part is reduced by 4% of the damage received. This is called wear damage
and can only be removed with a [](Skeleton_Repair_Bed.md). If a character is a non-skeleton,
their non-robotic body parts will be bandaged at a high rate while
sleeping on a Repair Bed as well.

## Splints

Splints are a near instant way to rig up to 51 hit (26 for small
splints) points, on a unit's limbs when below 47.5 HP. A splint cannot
be used to go above 50 effective HP, even if you have not used the full
50 points of splint value, it will stop at 50 HP if it gets there. The
[small splint kit](Splint_Kit.md "wikilink") only rigs up to 26 HP, if the
Field medic skill of the player is also at least 25. You won't be able
to see the effect of a splint if the character's health is too far into
the negative.

Putting Splinting in the jobs list is particularly useful. Character
with splinted legs can often run at close to full speed, and splints on
limbs can prevent limb loss as splinting adds to the hit points of the
limb.

Hive Workers and Hive Princes are the only races that can run at full
speed with splints. Running at full speed requires 55.6% leg health, and
Hive Workers and Hive Princes can achieve this number due to having
lower max HP on their legs. The 50 HP splint cap is more than 55% of
their max HP, allowing them to run their normal speed.

## Limb Replacement

If a character's limb is hit beyond a negative value equivalent to their
normal max health, it will be amputated. Amputated limbs will require a
robotic replacement in order to function normally when fighting or, if a
leg is lost, when doing almost anything. Robotic limbs require repairing
in the same way as a [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink")'s body does. They
also suffer wear and tear damage which can only be healed through use of
a [Skeleton Repair Bed](Skeleton_Repair_Bed.md "wikilink").

[Robot Limbs](Robot_Limbs.md "wikilink") can be purchased in a [](Robotics_Shop.md), a [](Robotics_Workshop.md), a [](Travel_and_Repairs_Shop.md), and a [](Hive_Robotics_Shop.md) or found in locations as
[Artifacts](Artifacts.md "wikilink"). Always make sure that you are
purchasing the correct limb, as the icon designs for (right) and (left)
limbs are not distinctly different. Robot Limbs are equipment, not trade
goods, so their sell value is noticeably lower than the cost to purchase
them from a store.

In order to equip a Robot Limb, you need to first click the Limbs button
found in your amputee character's inventory. After opening the Limbs
inventory, you can click and drag the limb to its correct slot or simply
right click it from your character's inventory. Characters which are not
amputees will not allow you to make use of this button for obvious
reasons.

- There is an exploit to heal [robotic limbs](Robot_Limbs.md "wikilink") to
  full health. If you put your damaged robotics limbs in your inventory,
  save and then load the game they will be fully healed.

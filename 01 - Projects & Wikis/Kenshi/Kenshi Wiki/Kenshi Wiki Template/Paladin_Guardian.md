**Paladin Guardians** are rare soldiers of the [](Holy_Nation.md). They are found exclusively in [](Narko's_Trap.md), guarding it from would-be tech hunters
and thieves seeking access to the unique [](Narko's_Evil_Tower.md). They intend on keeping Narko's Trap
a secret, and will attack anyone on sight.

They are practically identical to normal [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"),
except they use the colors of [High Paladins](High_Paladin.md "wikilink").
They can be visually distinguished from High Paladins by the fact they
wear a cloth shirt instead of a chain shirt, and have different
headgear, giving them a unique appearance.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction.

- [Skinhouse HQ](Skinhouse_HQ.md "wikilink")
- [Skinhouse](Skinhouse.md "wikilink") x2

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Barrier Tower](Barrier_Tower.md "wikilink")

  [Droneguards](Droneguard.md "wikilink")) - if [](Queen_of_the_South.md) is alive and
  [Savant](Savant.md "wikilink") is dead.

## Tips

- Don't get knocked out. If you do, religiously guard the downed
  characters.
- Bring enough [Sleeping Bags](Sleeping_Bag.md "wikilink") for around half
  of your squad.
- [](Skin_Bandits.md) They are extremely dangerous, do not
  approach them, and go out of your way to avoid them. Any character
  with less than 50-60 Melee Attack/Defense should not attempt to fight
  them, should they notice a(nother) Human in the party.
- Do not stay in this zone for long.
- Bring a lot of reserve human food if your squad eats human food.
- Although Acid protection is practically required, sacrificing
  conventional protection to attain 100% acid protection is not advised,
  60-80% is good enough for those travelling through.
- The [Crab Helmet](Crab_Helmet.md "wikilink") is the best helmet for any
  non-crossbow characters traveling through this zone, take or buy some
  in preparation.
- Consider bringing one fabric for a [](Mercenary_Tent.md) (one tent will protect ~30 characters
  from acid).
- Sonorous Dark is slightly more dangerous and much worse for money than
  the [surrounding zones](Ashlands.md "wikilink"), leave the zone as
  quickly as possible.
- Consider equipping your squad with Hackers (especially the [](Paladin's_Cross.md)), as they do bonus damage against
  the most common enemies in this area.
- Don't die.

Dead Cat is a neutral [faction](Factions_(Alpha).md "wikilink") that own
the towns of [Catan](Catun_(Alpha).md "wikilink"),
[Clownsteady](Clownsteady_(Alpha).md "wikilink"),
[Telbooze](Telbooze.md "wikilink"), [Bark](Bark_(Alpha).md "wikilink") and
[Heft](Heft_(Alpha).md "wikilink"). Dead Cat is protected by Mercenaries
and Police. Currently this faction does not have any patrols associated
with it but on occasion the Police in town will wander off. Since these
towns do have Police they are a good place turn
in [bounties](Bounty.md "wikilink"). 

Dead Cat starts out with a negative relation with The Holy Nation. If
you start a game with a [](Game_Starts.md#The_Holy_Sword) character you will spawn
in Catan.

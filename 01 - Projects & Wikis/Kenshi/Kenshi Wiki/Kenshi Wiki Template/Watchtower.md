The Watchtower is a tall building shell that has 4 floors including the
roof and can be equipped with both [Turrets](Turrets.md "wikilink") and
[Harpoon Turrets](Harpoon_Turret.md "wikilink") on the roof. It is commonly
used for base defence due to the large height bonus it provides to
turrets.

Players can construct this building after researching [](Large_Building_Shells_(Tech).md). Not that it matters in
game, but the Watchtower has the highest building condition of all the
[Building](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") types. It would have made perfect
sense had engines of war been introduced to [Kenshi](Kenshi.md "wikilink").

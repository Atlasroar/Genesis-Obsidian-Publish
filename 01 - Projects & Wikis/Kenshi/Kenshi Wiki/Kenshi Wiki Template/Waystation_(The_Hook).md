This [Waystation](Waystation.md "wikilink") is between
[Clownsteady](Clownsteady.md "wikilink") and [](Drifter's_Last.md). There are quality 80
[Copper](Copper.md "wikilink") mines nearby. [The Freedom
Seekers](https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Starts#Starts#The_Freedom_Seekers)
can start in this town.

This location can be a good place to hide out after escaping slavery
from the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"). However, trade
caravans from the [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink") occasionally
stop here and might attack such escaped slaves.

As with all other non-ruined Waystations, this place has a 25% chance to
spawn pacifiers from [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), [](Traders_Guild.md), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

**Blue Eyes** is a wanted criminal in the UC who can be found in
[Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink"), likely in a bar. She frequently brags about
her exploits, making it easy to notice her. In [](The_Swamp.md), players can find [](Note_From_Blue_Eyes.md) in which she writes about making
it to the swamps.

Although Blue Eyes is supposed to spawn with a Jitte, the quantity
setting for the weapon spawn is set to 0, so she is unarmed instead.

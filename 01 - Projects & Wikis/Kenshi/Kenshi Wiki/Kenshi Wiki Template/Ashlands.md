The **Ashlands** is an ashen landscape which was the domain of the
[Second Empire](Second_Empire.md "wikilink"). Groups of Skeletons and Iron
Spiders of the [Skeleton Legion](Skeleton_Legion.md "wikilink") patrol this
area, alongside the occasional [](Cleanser_Unit.md). There are also large clouds of [](Weather_Effects.md#Gas) which periodically appear in this
area. As such, players are advised to bring [](Fog_Mask.md) if their characters are vulnerable to this
danger.

This Zone is a very good source of [](Research_Artifacts.md) as well as multiple
[Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") and [Edgewalker](Edgewalkers.md "wikilink")
grade weapons.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") in the Ashlands. This
zone does not spawn [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps.

###  Minor Outposts

*These locations are typically small towns, villages, or faction bases.*

- [Cat-Lon's Exile](Cat-Lon's_Exile.md "wikilink")

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these

with anything at this location.*

nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

## Tips

- Either bring a [Fog Mask](Fog_Mask.md "wikilink") or avoid gas clouds to
  the best of your ability.
- If you have a good sneaky character, this location can be an excellent
  source of income if you are not concerned with using artifacts for
  research (one can easily come back with hundreds of thousands of cats
  worth of loot from a single run).
- One way to get to the Ashlands is through [](Stobe's_Gamble.md) and then to [](Sniper_Valley.md), then go around the
  [Skinhouse](Skinhouse.md "wikilink") in the north east. Going through
  [Cheaters Run](Cheaters_Run.md "wikilink") and then [](Sonorous_Dark.md) coast has robots if you are curious
  about entering their shacks.
- You can safely swim into the Ashlands by entering a bit east of the
  [Sniper Tower](Sniper_Tower.md "wikilink"), provided you do not look at
  it.
- Gas clouds do not spawn inside of [](Cat-Lon's_Exile.md) so you can feel free to remove any
  gas protection when there. You are also immune to gas clouds when
  inside/on top of a building. This includes the domes themselves.

## Trivia

- Some brief mentions in-game of "Ashland Drifters" likely refer to the
  mysterious individuals that ventured through this area. They appear to
  have [](Ashlander_Stormgoggles.md)/[](Ashland_Hat.md) and
  [Dustcoat](Dustcoat.md "wikilink")/[](Sleeveless_Dustcoat.md) as their equipment and is
  mentioned by [Flats Lagoon](Flats_Lagoon.md "wikilink")
  [bartender](Lagoon_Barman.md "wikilink") as well as having one
  interviewed by [Iyo](Iyo.md "wikilink") in [](Tech_Hunter's_Notes_Series.md).

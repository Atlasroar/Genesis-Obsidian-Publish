**Hive Attack**, not to be confused with the [](Hive_Attack_(Western_Hive).md), is an
[Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has kidnapped the [](Queen_of_the_South.md). It has a 100% chance to trigger
if the player has a [Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink")
within 50,000 meters of a [Southern Hive](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink")
location, but given that distance is larger than the map of Kenshi and
the event ignores No-Go zones, it will trigger anywhere in the map with
the same frequency.

Once the conditions have been fulfilled, the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md) will send an assault to the player's
base. Depending on if it is the first trigger of the event or if it is a
repeat visit, there are different squad make ups.

1.  The first visit variant is made up of 7 squads, each made up of 8
    [Droneguards](Droneguard.md "wikilink"), 1 [](War_Gorillo.md), and led by a
    [Prince](Prince.md "wikilink").
2.  The second and later visits are made up of 6 squads, each made up of
    8 [Droneguards](Droneguard.md "wikilink"), 1 [](War_Gorillo.md), and led by a
    [Prince](Prince.md "wikilink"). With one squad being accompanied by
    [King](King.md "wikilink"), though due to a bug this variant of King is
    a weaker one than the one found at [](Southern_Hive_(Location).md).

When the assault arrives, the War Leader will shout about the queen,
then order the attack, attacking gate and characters, and liberating
captives. If the assault is defeated, another **Hive Attack** will
trigger in 20-32 hours if it was the first visit, or in 12-24 hours if
it was a later visit.

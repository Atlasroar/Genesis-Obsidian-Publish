**Skimmers** are nocturnal large insectoids native to desert climates.
They are tall four-legged beaked antlions with antennae and a fanged
mouth. They're large and fierce carnivores who feed on corpses.

If one Skimmer spawns alone it will hunt without resting. However,
Skimmers from nests and larger squads will conceal themselves under the
ground to sleep from 6:00 to 23:00, only waking up before then if
something walks too close. Once awoken (During the day) Skimmers will go
back to sleep after wandering for around 140 in game minutes without
entering combat.

Skimmers can spawn in [Skimmer Nests](Skimmer_Nest.md "wikilink") and
[Small Skimmer Nests](Small_Skimmer_Nest "wikilink") in
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"), [Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink"), and
[The Great Desert](The_Great_Desert.md "wikilink").

Bodyparts of adults have around 200-250 HP. Their attacks damage a
single target.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Usually, animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon", but
Skimmers are different. They have
[unknown](Unknown_(manufacturer).md "wikilink") quality weapons, so they
only have 2 qualities. (Moving their position in a squad, saving and
then reloading can change to another quality of the weapon) Their
"weapon" provides them with 23 cut damage which is unaffected by stats.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.84006 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.013) + Strength (0.039)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut = 23** + 0.85332(Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.026) + Strength (0.078)

## Trivia

- Skimmers are extremely vulnerable to [](Desert_Sabre.md), making it a good weapon to defeat
  them.
- When Skimmers are buried in the sand, they are actually sleeping. They
  are nocturnal animals.
- Skimmers make the same sound as the [Spiders](Skin_Spider.md "wikilink")
  do.

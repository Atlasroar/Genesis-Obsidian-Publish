**Crabs** are large, red crustacean-esque creatures that are usually
hostile. They populate the [Howler Maze](Howler_Maze.md "wikilink"), and
can also be found in [The Pits East](The_Pits_East.md "wikilink") and [](The_Unwanted_Zone.md). Adult crabs can be seen
patrolling the island and locations of the Howler Maze.

Crabs can also be found in [Crab Nests](Crab_Nest.md "wikilink") which can
contain anywhere between 5 to 30 baby crabs. Crabs can be nesting inside
buildings which are intact in the Howler Maze, making exploring those
buildings dangerous. Up to 7 [Crab Eggs](Crab_Egg.md "wikilink") can be
found sitting on the ground in the center of a Crab Nest.

There are many unique powerful crabs such as the
[Megacrab](Megacrab.md "wikilink"), found in the [](Lost_Town.md).

Crabs can be purchased from [Crab Raiders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink") in
[Crab Town](Crab_Town.md "wikilink") and [](Crab_Village.md). They are sold at [](Crab_Shop.md). An adult crab costs approximately 14,000
Cats.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which Crabs
have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

## Play Style

Crabs can be bought from the [Crab Town](Crab_Town.md "wikilink"). Crabs
have the slowest movement speed of any animal purchasable in game. They
make up for this by having quick and fast high damage attacks which can
hit 2 enemies at a time. This makes crabs useful at picking off units
separated from their squad. As with all animals the older they get, the
further their attacks can reach.

## Spawns

### Regions

The Pits and The Pits East are prime areas to find Crabs as well as
[Crab Raiders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink"). They also spawn in the **Howler
Maze** and **the** **Unwanted Zone**.

### Spawn Groups

### Other Locations

Crabs are also found on [Fishman Island](Fishman_Island.md "wikilink").
[Gurglers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink") will consistently outnumber crabs on the
island until the death of [King Gurgler,](King_Gurgler.md "wikilink") at
which point Gurglers and their [nests](Gurgler_Nest.md "wikilink") will
stop spawning. Only crab patrols will spawn afterwards.

- Crabs have the same sound effect as [Spiders](Spiders.md "wikilink") and
  [Skimmers](Skimmers.md "wikilink").

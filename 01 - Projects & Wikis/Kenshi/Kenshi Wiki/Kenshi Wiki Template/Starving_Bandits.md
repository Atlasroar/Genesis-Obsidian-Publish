The **Starving Bandits** are a weak, hostile
[faction](Factions.md "wikilink") with very little organizational
structure. They are found roaming primarily in and around [](Holy_Nation.md) lands.

This faction doesn't have any named characters, bases, or an overall
faction leader.

They are made up from the hopeless and penniless characters who have
resorted to banditry to feed themselves. Whether blood or fortune, they
will do whatever it takes to survive in the desolate badlands. Due to
their fragile states, many are weak and untrained for combat, but they
have strength in numbers.

They will attack neutral targets on sight, or beg them for money on
occasion, and will also attack wild animals in order to butcher them for
meat.

The fact that many of them are bald suggest that many of them are
escaped [slaves](Slavery.md "wikilink").

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

## Relations

### Faction Relations

This faction has no special relations with any factions. Their default
relation is -10.

### Player Relations

*The reasons for this faction to have a non-zero relation towards you.*

- If the relations with the player are not hostile, they will
  occasionally come up to speak with you and ask for either 50c, 500c or
  1,500c. Giving them 50c doesn't change alignment, giving them 500c
  raises it by +2, and giving them 1,500c raises it by +5.

## Locations



## Tips

- If you wish to avoid having your food stolen after being knocked out
  by Starving Bandits, you can put your party member's food inside of a
  backpack and store it in your inventory rather than equipped, or drop
  it on the ground and wait for them to leave before recovering it.
- If you are allied with Starving Bandits, they no longer attack you on
  sight in any situation, and if you respond to their request for food
  positively then they will bodyguard the character who spoke to them
  for 24 hours. However, despite the dialogue implying that you are
  giving them money, no Cats are subtracted from your total.
- Giving a group of Starving Bandits enough money to raise the faction's
  alignment towards you turns that specific group of Starving Bandits
  into friendly NPCs, meaning that they will defend you from any nearby
  enemies, although they will not follow you like they will when they
  are allies.

## Trivia

- Despite being a representation of the lowlifes and outcasts in
  mainstream society, similar to [](Rebel_Farmers.md) and [](Starving_Vagrant.md), the Starving Bandits do not
  appear to decrease in numbers or cease spawning if [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) leaders are
  [killed/imprisoned](World_States.md "wikilink").

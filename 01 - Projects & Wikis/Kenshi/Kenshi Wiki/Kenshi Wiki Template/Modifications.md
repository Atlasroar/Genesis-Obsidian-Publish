There are several types of modifications (or mods as they are popularly
known), mods have a variety of effects, from adding one weapon to total
overhauls of the game mechanics. You can also create your own
modifications to your Kenshi game via the 'Forgotten Construction Set'
located in your Kenshi directory.

## Game Modifications

Game Changing modifications can add many new things to the game from
unique play styles, new areas, and even Immunity to death. Modifications
can also be found listed

forums.

## Adding Mods to Kenshi

Mods can be located through Lo-Fi Games Forum, the Steam Workshop, Nexus
Mods, or simply shared between friends. Players can add more mods to
their game or remove the mods previously installed easily. After
changing which mods are selected, always remember to import your game to
avoid issues.

### Subscribing to Mods on Steam

This method is only available for players who have purchased their game
through Steam.

### Other ways

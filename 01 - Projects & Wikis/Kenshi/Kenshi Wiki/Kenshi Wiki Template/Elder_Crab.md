**Elder Crabs** are larger and stronger variants of the normal
[Crab](Crab.md "wikilink"). They can be found rarely wandering certain
eastern regions of the map.

Though they are significantly stronger than a standard crab, they are
still quite outclassed by their larger siblings such as the
[Megacrab](Megacrab.md "wikilink") and the ones found in the [](Crab_Tournament.md). They spawn at an age of 1.9 to
2.0 meaning their base stats are multiplied by that amount.

**Assassin's Rags** are Light Armour that are equipped in the Body
Armour slot. It is notable for having 100% coverage for the striking
(right) arm only, leaving other parts of the body much less defended.
This armor is also notable in that it provides 100% fist protection,
making it useful for [Martial Arts](Martial_Arts.md "wikilink") specialists
who have not replaced their limbs with superior Robotic ones.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **6x4**.

## Appearance

**Assassin's Rags** are depicted as ragged cloths loosely wrapped around
the neck and shoulder. The right arm is protected by metal plates
strapped over thick cloth, which cover most of the arm. The left arm is
slightly less covered with the cloth only covering below the elbow.
Leather wrappings covering part of the stomach finish the ensemble off.

## Trivia/Notes

- Since its debut, the name of the equipment is misspelled as "Assassins
  Rags" because the apostrophe is missing on the 's'. This was finally
  fixed in 0.98.4X.
- Assassin's Rags has the highest bonus Dexterity, Combat Speed and
  Attack of any clothing piece. It is tied with Ninja rags for the best
  dodge bonus as well.

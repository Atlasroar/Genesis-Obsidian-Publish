The Holy Nation Route is a [](World_State_Routes.md) where the player has allied
relationship with [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") and
having initiated dialogue with [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) that opens up the questline for
HN.

After the initiation of the questline, Phoenix will tell the player to
capture [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink"), the leader of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md). Or [Seto](Seto.md "wikilink"), the
daughter of the leader of [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink"):
[Esata the Stone Golem](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink").

Turning Moll in after capturing her will cause the dialogue to switch to
Seto, and vice-versa. If both of them are captured, the dialogue with
Phoenix hits an infinite cycle of switching between Seto and Moll,
possibly due to World States dialogue of Phoenix written incompletely
causing this/these loophole(s). If the appropriate conditions are
achieved, it may be possible to switch to
[Mukai](Mukai_the_Mountain.md "wikilink") (if FB is not alive) or [](Flying_Bull.md) (if Mukai is not alive) or Esata as the
target.

Though it appears that the player can capture [](Emperor_Tengu.md) and [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") and
have special dialogues when turning in, which could possibly mean that
if the dialogue was completed they would've also been included to this
route.

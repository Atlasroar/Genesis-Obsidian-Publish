**Chain Headwrap** is [Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") equipped in the
[Headgear](Headgear.md "wikilink") slot. It currently does not belong to
any armour class and is listed as being made from cloth.

## Appearance

Chain Headwrap and [](Blackened_Chain_Headwrap.md) are identical in
appearance with the exception of the color. The wrap which is roughly
the width of a hand, wraps around the character's head starting at the
brow. It covers a fair portion of the skull but leaves the neck, face
and top of the head exposed to strikes.

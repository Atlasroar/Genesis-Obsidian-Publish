A recruit that was available for a brief period around update 0.93.14,
before being removed in one of the patches immediately following as it
was causing bugs in [Crumblejon's](Crumblejon.md "wikilink") dialog.

His dialog involved some semi-supernatural concepts or illusions,
involving seemingly living shadows. It's unclear where this would have
gone if he'd stayed in the game, or if he was even intended to go to the
live builds.

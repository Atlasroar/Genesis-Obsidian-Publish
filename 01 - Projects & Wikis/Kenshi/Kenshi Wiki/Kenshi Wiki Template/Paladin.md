**Paladins** are soldiers for [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), typically acting as veteran troops
and occasionally as squad leaders. They often go on patrols alongside
[Holy Servants](Holy_Servant.md "wikilink"), and are commanded by [](High_Paladin.md). They can also instead act as leaders
commanding [Holy Sentinels](Holy_Sentinel.md "wikilink").

Paladins can be seen manning [Crossbow Turrets](Turrets.md "wikilink") on
walls and rooftops in Holy Nation towns. However, most of the day-to-day
guarding of towns is handled by [](Holy_Sentinel.md), who are slightly weaker than
Paladins. Sentinels are distinguished by their reddish armor with a
white emblem, while Paladins have more grayish armor with a yellow
emblem as well as having a Paladin's Cross instead of a Combat Cleaver.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction.

## Player Interactions

Paladins may offer friendly conversation to male human characters, where
they can be asked about [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink") and the Holy Nation.
The player can also prompt them to attack by espousing the word of
[Narko](Narko.md "wikilink").

They are leading both the [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Minor).md) and the [](Holy_Assault.md) against a [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md) as War Leaders.

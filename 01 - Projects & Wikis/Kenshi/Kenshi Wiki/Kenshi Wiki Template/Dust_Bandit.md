**Dust Bandits** are the most commonly found members of the [](Dust_Bandits.md) faction.

They spawn in squads of 5-10, led by a [Dust Boss](Dust_Boss.md "wikilink")
and sometimes accompanied by up to 4 [](Dust_Bandit_Bowman.md). These squads can be found
roaming [Shem](Shem.md "wikilink") or the [](Border_Zone.md).

They also populate [Dust Bandit Camps](Dust_Bandit_Camp.md "wikilink").
These camps contain 3 Dust Bandit squads, which are slightly larger than
their roaming counterparts.

They can also be found in the [](Dust_King_Tower.md) as guards, in a large group of 9-16.

Finally, they are part of the Bandit Demands event squad which is sent
to the player's outpost if it lies within the Dust Bandits' zone of
control.

Strangely, these bandits spawn as a prisoner under the
[Outlaw](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Outlaw.md "wikilink") faction inside [](Tengu's_Vault.md). 3 [Prisoners](Prisoner.md "wikilink") and
the unique recruit [Sinklyde](Sinklyde.md "wikilink") wear the same
equipment as these bandits.

They have a chance to spawn with a crossbow like [](Dust_Bandit_Bowman.md), but because of this they will
not have a melee weapon, as they lack a sidearm.

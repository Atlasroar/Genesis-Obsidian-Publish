**Sinkuun** is a large peninsula located north-west of the [](The_Great_Desert.md). The peninsula is infamous for
being where the outcasts and bandits of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) live.

It is also where a relatively-isolated group of [](Western_Hive.md) have settled at.

The **Flotsam Village** is the base of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) and home of [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink"),
their leader. It is located in the [](Hidden_Forest.md), to the North of
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") and west of [](World's_End.md).

This town contains many residences. Most of the population is composed
of refugees and deserters from the Holy Nation. [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) guard this village and, as implied,
they are hostile to The Holy Nation. However, most of the townsfolk
still believe in and even worship [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink"), made clear
by how they react to seeing skeleton characters.

Many recruits can be found in this village including
[Digna](Digna.md "wikilink"), [Knife](Knife.md "wikilink"),
[Pia](Pia.md "wikilink"), [Reva](Reva.md "wikilink") and the generic randomly
named [Flotsam Recruit](Flotsam_Recruit.md "wikilink").

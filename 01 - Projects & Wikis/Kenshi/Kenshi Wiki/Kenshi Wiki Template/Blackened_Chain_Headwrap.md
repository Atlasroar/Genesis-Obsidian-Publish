**Blackened Chain Headwrap** is [Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") equipped in
the [Headgear](Headgear.md "wikilink") slot. It currently does not belong
to any armour class and is listed as being made from cloth.

## Appearance

Blackened Chain Headwrap and [Chain Headwrap](Chain_Headwrap.md "wikilink")
are identical in appearance with the exception of the color (this one,
as the name implies, is black). The wrap which is roughly the width of a
hand, wraps around the character's head stating at the brow. It covers a
fair portion of the skull but leaves the neck, face and top of the head
exposed to strikes.

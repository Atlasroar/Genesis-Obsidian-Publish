**Cannibals** are members of the [Cannibals](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink")
faction. They roam the [Cannibal Plains](Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink")
with several other members looking to capture people and return to their
outposts in order to consume their prisoners as food.

Despite obvious anatomical differences, a cannibal's gender is made
clear by the pattern of their war paint/tribal markings. Males wear
darker paint around their legs and have a rib cage like bone marking on
their upper torso. A female's paint is all done in a blood red pattern
with a symbol at their stomach that looks suspiciously close to the
symbol of [The Holy Nation](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"). They wear no
other clothing besides this paint/markings.

Despite living in harsh conditions, Cannibals are equipped with simple
[Basic First Aid Kits](Basic_First_Aid_Kit.md "wikilink"), which means that
they are aware of the dangers of having open wounds or passing out in
their unsafe neighborhood and/or they want to bandage up the victims
they captured for them to be alive and keep their 'meat fresh'.

A **Robotics Workshop** is a store dealing in [](Robot_Limbs.md) and other necessities for
[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink").

Robotics Workshops are located in [](Small_Shack.md). Only a [](Skeleton_Doctor.md) works in this shop. There is a
Robotic Bed that will restore the "wear" damage that caps a Skeleton's
max condition. This bed is also usable by any humanoid with Robotic
Limbs, and it will restore max condition to those limbs as well. In
addition to restoring max condition, it increases the heal speed of
Skeletons and Robotic Limbs just as sleeping in a normal bed helps
organic parts.

There is a similar, larger shop in [](Black_Desert_City.md) called [](Robotics_Shop.md). There is an almost identical shop found
in [Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"), [](Mongrel_Robotics_Workshop.md).

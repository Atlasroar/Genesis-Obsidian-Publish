The **Spider Foreman** is a dangerous character of the [](Old_Machines.md) faction found in the [](Spider_Factory.md) on the [](Forbidden_Isle.md).

This enemy can be easily identified by his uncommon head and silvery
[Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") grade [Staff](Staff.md "wikilink"). Despite
wielding only a staff, this enemy can be easily lethal. The large range
of the staff allows him to hit many foes in one swing.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If **Spider Foreman** is killed or imprisoned, [](Iron_Spider.md) will cease to spawn, while
[Goats](Goat.md "wikilink") and [Garrus](Garru.md "wikilink") will start
patrolling in **Forbidden Isle**.

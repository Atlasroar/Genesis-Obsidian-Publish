**The Mystery Of Skeletech Series** is a pair of
[book](Lore_Books.md "wikilink") [Items](Items.md "wikilink"). These items can
be found with the 'unique' tag at Science HQ in [](World's_End.md). However, it can also be found without the
'unique' label in [The Great Library](The_Great_Library.md "wikilink") in
[Black Scratch](Black_Scratch.md "wikilink").

The books contain theories into the destruction of the former empires.
The first book was written by the current leader of the
[Machinists](Machinists.md "wikilink"), [Finch](Finch.md "wikilink") and the
second was written by [Idad](Idad.md "wikilink").

The first possible scenario that he theorized about
[Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") having a safe place of incubation is
later noted that people have not yet discovered any supporting evidence
for this scenario in [](Mass_Extinction_Series.md) written by Finch. The results from
their plan to carry out deeper excavation around central plains can be
found in [Mass Extinction III](Mass_Extinction_Series.md "wikilink")
written by [Atticus](Atticus.md "wikilink"). [ru:Серия книг "Загадка

**Hooded Empire Noble Guards**are elite guards of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) and [](Traders_Guild.md). They are most commonly found guarding
the nobles of these factions. They accompany their lords and ladies
inside their [Noble House](Noble_House.md "wikilink") and outside in the
streets, shouting down any peasant who dares cross the noble's path, and
attacking any that doesn't obey.

These elite guards can also be found in the wilds, led by [](Noble_Captain.md) and guarding [](Noble_Hunter.md) who search for prey, whether it be man
or beast.

[Lady Sanda](Lady_Sanda.md "wikilink")'s retinue is composed of these
guards as well as [](Sanda's_Noble_Guard.md)

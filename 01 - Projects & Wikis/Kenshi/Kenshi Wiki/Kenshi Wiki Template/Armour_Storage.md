**Armour Storage** are containers that can be built inside player
buildings ([constructed](Construction.md "wikilink") or bought). They
cannot be placed anywhere else, unlike some other forms of storage that
can be constructed both inside and outside. They are used to store
[Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") and [Clothing](Clothing.md "wikilink"), and can
only hold those types of [items](items.md "wikilink").

When placing Armour Storage, consider that characters can get stuck in
parallel rows of armour chests if they are placed as close as the BUILD
mode allows. Experiment with placing these rows of chests so that they
are apart by at least a length of a single individual chest, removing
the possibility to get stuck.

Placing stolen items in the Armour Storage container will clear them of
their "stolen" tag.

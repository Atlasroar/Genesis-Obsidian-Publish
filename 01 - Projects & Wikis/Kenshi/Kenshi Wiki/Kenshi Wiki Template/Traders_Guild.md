The **Traders Guild** is an allegedly neutral faction that deal
primarily with commerce between towns. They're based in the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), and are integral to their economy.
That said, they use their status to gain access to many other factions
throughout the world, even the enemies of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) such as the [](Holy_Nation.md). 

Traders Guild will always start out neutral to the player's faction,
except for the [Wandering Trader](Wandering_Trader.md "wikilink") start in
which you start with 75 reputation with the Traders Guild. If you have a
shop set to public near or on a trade route members of the guild will
sometimes stop by to purchase particular items from you.

Many [Shop Guards](Shop_Guard.md "wikilink"), [](Caravan_Guard.md), and even privately-hired
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink") warriors are employed by the Traders Guild
to protect their assets, with the latter notably being deployed around
the Traders Guild headquarters in [](Trader's_Edge.md), a de-facto district of
[Heng](Heng.md "wikilink").

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

## Relations

### Faction Relations

*The factions this faction has special relations towards, though they
may not share the same opinion. For all others, it will use this
faction's default (0)*

- [Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink") (+100)

<!-- -->

- [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") (+100)

### Player Relations

*The reasons for this faction to have a non-zero relation towards you.*

- If you are allied with the [Anti-Slavers](Anti_Slavers.md "wikilink"),
  you will lose 30 relation with this faction.

<!-- -->

- If you kill or Imprison [Lady Kana](Lady_Kana.md "wikilink") or
  [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink"), you will seriously damage this faction's
  view towards you.
- Choosing pro-slavery dialogue with [Lady Kana](Lady_Kana.md "wikilink")
  or [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") will increase relationship with them,
  choosing anti-slavery dialogue will decrease relationship with them.

### Alliances

All bad deeds can be forgiven with cats, at least with the Traders
Guild. In [Blister Hill](Blister_Hill.md "wikilink") you can find the
Trader Guilds [Pacifier](Pacifiers.md "wikilink"), you can pay him to make
the others in the guild to turn a blind eye to your past deeds.

You can also make an alliance with the Traders Guild, obviously it will
cost you a fair bit of cats, c.100,000 to be exact.
[Yamdu](Yamdu.md "wikilink"), located at the Trader Guild's HQ in [](Trader's_Edge.md) will offer you this deal if you talk to
him. If you have an Outpost, you can choose the option to reduce the
price to c. 75,000.

This will affect your faction relationships with:

- +75 [Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- +75 [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- -30 [Anti-Slavers](Anti_Slavers.md "wikilink")

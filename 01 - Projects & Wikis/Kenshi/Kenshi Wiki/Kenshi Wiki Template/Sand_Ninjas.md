The **Sand Ninjas** are a [Faction](Factions.md "wikilink") led by [](Sand_Ninja_Oni.md). They are typically found in the
northeastern desert area.

The Sand Ninjas are a cult of highly skilled highwaymen, who attack any
passersby they deem weak. Some ninjas must go through cult challenges to
prove their worthiness as lieutenants: such as surviving the badlands
alone. These challenges might involve getting limbs broken as Sand Ninja
Jounins are among the few characters in game to be carrying [](Splint_Kit.md).

Sand Ninjas will no longer [raid](Ninja_Raid.md "wikilink") the player's
[outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") if their leader is
[kidnapped or killed](World_States.md "wikilink"), or if the player is
allied with the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") or the
[Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink").

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

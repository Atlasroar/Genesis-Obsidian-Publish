The **Swamped Lab** is an [Ancient Lab](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink") which
is located in [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink") to the southwest of
[Shark](Shark.md "wikilink"). This location is surrounded by [](Blood_Spider.md). Inside of the lab, there are inactive
[Security Spiders](Security_Spider.md "wikilink"), making this lab
preferable to other labs.

[Red Sabre](Red_Sabres.md "wikilink") (and [](Swamp_Ninjas.md)) squads can often be found attacking
the blood spiders in this area, distracting them from guarding the lab.
This possible encounter can be used to get inside the lab. As the gang
will almost certainly loose the fight, the looting and return voyage
must be made with caution and speed.

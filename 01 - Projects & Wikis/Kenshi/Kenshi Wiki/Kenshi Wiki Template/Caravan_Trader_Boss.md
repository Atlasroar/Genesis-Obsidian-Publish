**Caravan Trader Bosses**are named traders of the [](Traders_Guild.md) and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). As their name implies they lead
caravans in areas controlled by these factions, trading supplies outside
of city walls.

If [Harmothoe](Harmothoe.md "wikilink") is killed, one replaces her as the
leader of the [Free Traders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Free_Traders.md "wikilink") caravan.

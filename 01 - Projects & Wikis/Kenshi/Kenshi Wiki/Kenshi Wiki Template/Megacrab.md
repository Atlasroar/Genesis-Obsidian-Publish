**Megacrab** is one of the biggest [Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink") of all,
currently inhabiting the [Lost Town](Lost_Town.md "wikilink") in [](Howler_Maze.md). The crab's presence here might explain
the destruction of the town or the ruins may predate the Crabs. It is
similar to the giant crabs that assault the player faction base during
the [Crab Tournament](Crab_Tournament.md "wikilink"). Players can loot a
unique trophy after defeating this crab: [](Megacrab_Ganglion.md).

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which all
[Crabs](Crabs.md "wikilink") have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

## Spawns

The Megacrab can only be found in [Lost Town](Lost_Town.md "wikilink"). It
is unique and will not respawn, though similarly huge crabs accompany
the Crab Raiders during Crab Tournaments.

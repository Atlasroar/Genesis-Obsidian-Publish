**Cannibal Swarm** is an [Event](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") defeats the [](Cannibal_Raid.md) or [](Scrawny_Raid.md) events.

Once triggered, the Cannibals will send an assault to the player's base.
This assault will consist of 2-11 squads, with more spawning if the
squads spawned are smaller, and fewer spawning if the squads are larger.
These squads will consist of most often 6-25
[Cannibals](Cannibal.md "wikilink"), and less often 10-35 [](Scrawny_Cannibal.md).

When the assault arrives the War Leader will shout "Meat!" a number of
times, before the attack begins. At which point the cannibals will begin
attacking gates and characters, and kidnapping fallen characters to take
back to their village or camp. Characters taken will be eaten later if
not rescued.

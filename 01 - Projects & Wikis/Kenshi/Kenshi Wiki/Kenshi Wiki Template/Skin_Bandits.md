eventually kill the prisoner.

## Relations

### Faction Relations

*The factions this faction has special relations towards. For all
others, it will use this faction's default (0).*

- [Skeleton Legion](Skeleton_Legion.md "wikilink") (100)
- [Reavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink") (-100)
- [Crab Raiders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink") (-100)
- [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") (-100)
- [Fishmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink") (coexistence)
- [Old Machines](Old_Machines.md "wikilink") (coexistence)

### Player Relations

*The reasons for this faction to have a non-zero relation towards you.*

- Skin Bandits can be allied with if the player is a
  [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink").
- If the player is a Hiver, Skeleton, or a [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink"), Skin
  Bandits are not hostile in their towns.

### Alliances

Players can ally with the Skin Bandits by speaking to
[Savant](Savant.md "wikilink"), although only if the player character is a
Skeleton. As with the other warring Southeast Factions, allying with the
Skin Bandits results in the other 3 factions becoming enemies. These are
the specific relations changes:

- [Crab Raiders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink") -75
- [Reavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink") -75
- [Skeleton Bandits](Skeleton_Bandits.md "wikilink") -75
- Skin Bandits +75

## Base Assault

The Skin Bandits will assault your base if you are within relative range
to their location.

### The Big Skin Harvest

This assault consists of around 2 squads or ~36 units that will approach
your base and say upon arrival

> "A Human Village . . ." "Full of Fresh Skins . . ." "And Lots of Human
> Food For Our Hungry Bellies . . ."

They then will proceed to attack.

## Trivia

- Both [Skeleton Bandits](Skeleton_Bandits.md "wikilink") and **Skin
  Bandits** have neutral relations with each other however they will
  still fight. They also share the same (100) opinion for [](Skeleton_Legion.md). However, the Legion still tends
  to attack both factions.
- The Skin Bandits in Skinhouse HQ have an AI Goal to kill a random
  prisoner. Getting put inside a [](Peeler_Machine.md) can lead to a quick death because
  of this.
- The Skin Bandits in the North and South Skinhouses lack the previously
  mentioned AI Goal however they will attack and put a character back
  into a Peeler Machine if they break out.
- The Skin Bandits inside of the [](Horrible_Ruin.md) lack either of the AI Goals previously
  mentioned. However, they will still place certain races into the
  Peelers if they are unconscious nearby. (Or
  Hostile)![](Skin_Bandit_squad.jpg "Skin_Bandit_squad.jpg")

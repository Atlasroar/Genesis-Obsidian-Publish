![](AncientSamuraiSet.png "AncientSamuraiSet.png") **Ancient Samurai
Boots** is a Heavy Armour that is equipped in the Footwear slot. As the
[Second Empire](Second_Empire.md "wikilink") remnants who wear the Ancient
Samurai set are purely composed of [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") —
who cannot wear boots — this armour cannot be found in the game. Had it
existed in the game it would have been part of a set together with
[Ancient Samurai Helmet](Ancient_Samurai_Helmet.md "wikilink"), [](Ancient_Samurai_Armour.md) and [](Ancient_Samurai_Legplates.md).

This armour has inventory dimensions of **2x4**.

## Appearance

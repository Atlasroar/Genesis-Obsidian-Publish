**Swamp Turtles** are tall, passive creatures that can be found in [](The_Swamp.md). They travel alone or in pairs. In the
[South Wetlands](South_Wetlands.md "wikilink"), they can be found in groups
of 6. Unlike all other animals in Kenshi Swamp Turtles do not have a
weapon assigned to them. Because of this the game instead gives them a
random ancient quality weapon instead. (Due to this you'll find Swamp
Turtles with + and - attack/defense depending on which weapon they
spawned with)

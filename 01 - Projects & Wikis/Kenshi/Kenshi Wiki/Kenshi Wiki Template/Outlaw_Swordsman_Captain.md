**Outlaw Swordsman Captains** are skilled fighters and field leaders in
the [Rebel Farmers](Rebel_Farmers.md "wikilink") faction.

They can be found acting as [Boss Simion's](Boss_Simion.md "wikilink")
personal bodyguards in [Fort Simion](Fort_Simion.md "wikilink"). On
patrols, they usually lead patrols of [](Outlaw_Heavy.md) and [](Outlaw_Swordsman.md).

They are the strongest characters in the Rebel Farmers faction besides
[Boss Simion](Boss_Simion.md "wikilink") himself. They spawn with 2500-3500
Cat [bounties](Bounty.md "wikilink") on their heads.

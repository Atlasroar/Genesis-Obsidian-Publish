**Elder Blood Spiders** are larger [](Blood_Spider.md) that spawn at a much older age than
possible in normal gameplay.

Despite their size, their HP is still quite low. A reasonably skilled
character can generally bring one down in a single swing to their
vitals. And like their smaller brethren, they spawn in a large group,
causing them to be a major threat to even late game characters.

They are only found in one location, the [](Tower_of_Spiders.md).

## Stats

They spawn between 1.6 to 2.0 age with 40 combat stats along with 3 stat
randomization. As age is a multiplier for stats this means they can
reach the high 80s in their combat stats.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which Blood
Spiders have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

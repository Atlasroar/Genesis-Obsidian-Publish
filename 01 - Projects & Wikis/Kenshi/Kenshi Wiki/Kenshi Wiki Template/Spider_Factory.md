The **Spider Factory** is a complex located on the [](Forbidden_Isle.md) and contains both valuable loot and
powerful hostiles. Presumably built long ago during the war, now this
factory stands as the only notable thing left on the [](Forbidden_Isle.md).

As can be inferred from its name, the factory houses roughly 15
[Security Spiders](Security_Spider.md "wikilink") and [](Iron_Spider.md). They are led by a dangerous skeleton
named the [Spider Foreman](Spider_Foreman.md "wikilink"), who uses the
[Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") [Staff](Staff.md "wikilink").

If one can sneak by or defeat the spiders and the skeleton in charge,
they can possibly find plenty of [](Research_Artifacts.md), with at least 4 [](Ancient_Science_Book.md) and 2 [](Engineering_Research.md) littered in the locked metal
boxes.

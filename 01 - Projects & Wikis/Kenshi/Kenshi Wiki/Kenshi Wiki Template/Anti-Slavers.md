![](Anti-Slavers-0.png "Anti-Slavers-0.png") The **Anti-Slavers** are a
faction led by the legendary [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") in a fight
against [Slavery](Slavery.md "wikilink"). As a result, they gained many
powerful enemies such as the [Holy Nation](Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") and
the [United Cities](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") who prey on the weak and
exploited. Their base is located atop a mountain in the south west of
region of [Stobe's Gamble](Stobe's_Gamble.md "wikilink").

They usually don't use [Weapons](Weapons.md "wikilink") and are instead
skilled [Martial Arts](Martial_Arts.md "wikilink") fighters. They have
fighters from all kind of races including [Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink"),
[Humans](Human.md "wikilink"), [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink"), and
[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink").

## Relations

### Player Relations

*The reasons for this faction to have a non-zero relation towards you.*

- The Anti-Slavers' Pacifier will not talk to you if you are allied with
  [The Holy Nation](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"), the [](Traders_Guild.md), or the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md).
- The Anti-Slavers will hate you if you kill or imprison
  [Bo](Bo.md "wikilink"), [Grey](Grey.md "wikilink"),
  [Jaegar](Jaegar.md "wikilink"), or [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink").
- Players can ally with the Anti-Slavers by talking to
  [Grey](Grey.md "wikilink").  This will give you +75 Anti-Slavers and -30
  from [United Cities](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) and [](Traders_Guild.md) relations. If you have captured
  and/or killed [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") and talk to Tinfist, you
  will get +75 reputation with the anti-slavers instantly, without the
  -30 to the UC, Slave traders or Traders guild (but capturing Longen
  will still give the normal penalty.)

## Trivia

- Despite being otherwise fanatically opposed to slavery, the
  Anti-Slavers do not have a negative relation with the
  [Reavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink").

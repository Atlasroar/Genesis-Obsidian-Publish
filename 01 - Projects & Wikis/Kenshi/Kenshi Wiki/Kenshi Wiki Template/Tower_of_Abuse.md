The **Tower of Abuse** is the base of the [](Thrall_Masters.md). It is located in
[Venge](Venge.md "wikilink"). There are two [](Skeleton_Repair_Bed.md) on the top floor which can be used
for free, though advised to be used only after taking care with the
enemies in the surrounding area.

The leaders of the Thrall Masters [](Screamer_the_False.md) and [Ponk](Ponk.md "wikilink") can be
found inside the Tower.

The tower is also an [Ancient Tech Lab](Ancient_Tech_Lab.md "wikilink") and
can have Loot as with the [Artifacts](Artifacts.md "wikilink") System.

The unique recruit [Agnu](Agnu.md "wikilink") can be rescued from the
second level.

## Tips

- Go to Mourn or [Flats Lagoon](Flats_Lagoon.md "wikilink") and hire about
  2 squads of mercenaries or tech hunters, then go to Tower of Abuse and
  let them do the work, easy way to get about 100k cats. While this can
  work, it should be noted that more squads would greatly increase the
  chance of this being successful. It should also be noted that this
  process can be repeated so long as either [](Screamer_the_False.md) or [Ponk](Ponk.md "wikilink") is
  alive and free. With this condition, after walking a good distance and
  waiting for some time, this will cause the tower's items and non
  unique inhabitants to respawn.
- The Tower of Abuse is also a good place to train
  [Assassination](Assassination.md "wikilink"). Defeat the inhabitants and
  lock them into the cages on the second floor. As robots reboot very
  fast, you can repeatedly KO them and gain skill for it.
- This is a great place for combat training. Fill the cages with thralls
  and bosses. Pull them out one at a time and beat them up. While they
  reboot, get some free repairs on the repair bed. Or if you brought
  plenty of repair kits, train up your robotics skill. If you brought
  plenty of food and sleeping bags, you'll have nonstop training.
- Laying down in the repair bed as a skeleton and simply letting the
  inhabitants wail on you will level your **Dodge** and **Toughness** in
  a very hands off way as they don't always register that you are downed
  when knocked unconscious while using a bed and will keep swinging
  until you regain consciousness again. Type of armor at initiation may
  increase efficacy of this method until higher levels are reached. This
  may seem simply like an abuse of game mechanics and your poor
  character but hence the name of the location it is poetic.

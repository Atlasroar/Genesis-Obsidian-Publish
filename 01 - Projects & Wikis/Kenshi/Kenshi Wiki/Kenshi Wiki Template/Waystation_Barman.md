**Waystation Barmen** are named shopkeepers of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) and
[Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") found manning [](Adventurer_Bar.md).

Despite their name, the bars they sell their wares in can be found in
cities belonging to the Tech Hunters or Anti-Slavers, not just in
Waystations.

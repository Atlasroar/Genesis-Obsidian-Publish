Bandits are the most common enemy found in Kenshi. They are broken into
two groups - Dust Bandits and Starving Bandits. Bandits tend to travel
into groups of 3-8 and are automatically hostile to everyone, including
other bandit groups. Bandits also follow a leader (or boss) of their
small pack, who has marginally better attributes and equipment. They are
not as powerful as [Sand Ninjas](Sand_Ninjas.md "wikilink"), however, they
do travel in larger groups.

The **Ashland Dome Ruin** is an [](Ancient_Locations.md) controlled by [](Ancient_Ruins.md). This location does not have any
inhabitants or spawn any loot. The location can be marked by reading the
**Old Treasure [Map](Maps.md "wikilink")**, indicating that not long ago
this place was worthy of a visit. There are two Ashland Dome Ruins in
the Ashlands.

Given their placement in Ashlands relative to other [](Ashland_Dome_I.md), it is possible that there were other
2 high-ranking officers of the defunct Second Empire in these domes, but
they were destroyed as a result of the building being ruined. Either
that, or the placement of these buildings are purely aesthetic.

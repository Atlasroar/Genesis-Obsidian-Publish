**Letter To Moll** is a [book](Lore_Books.md "wikilink")
[item](Items.md "wikilink") which can only be found in [](Flotsam_Safehouse.md) and the Flotsam HQ in [](Flotsam_Village.md). This item is a letter written to
the leader of the [Flotsam Ninjas](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink"),
[Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") from presumably another [](Flotsam_Ninja.md).

This letter is about the dangers of living in [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and not following the Okranite
religion as strictly as it is enforced.

This letter itself is also considered an illegal item by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). If held in the player's inventory
during a bag search at a Holy Nation town, that character will receive a
[Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") for holding illegal goods and subsequently
attacked and/or arrested.

This item is not unique though, as Flotsam Safehouses might also spawn
in an [overwritten](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") version of
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") and the Flotsam HQ can also spawn in an
overwritten [Blister Hill](Blister_Hill.md "wikilink"). [ru:Письмо к

**Shek Ruins** is a group of destroyed buildings owned by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md). It can be easily accessed on top of a
rocky hill east of [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink") ,towards the direction of
[Squin](Squin.md "wikilink"). Various items are strewn about the entire
place which consists of 2 [Watchtower](Watchtower.md "wikilink"), 1
[Snailhouse](Snailhouse.md "wikilink"), 1 [L-House](L-House.md "wikilink"), 1
[Bughouse](Bughouse.md "wikilink"), 1 [Y-House](Y-House.md "wikilink").

From the looks of the ruins, the place may have served as a border
outpost during the Shek Kingdom's more prosperous past, perhaps
destroyed in their war with [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md).

The Sonorous Junk Reef is an area of shallow water south of the
[Sonorous Dark](Sonorous_Dark.md "wikilink") and west of the
[Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink") filled with twisted scrap and inactive
[Iron Spiders](Iron_Spider.md "wikilink"). While relatively safe it is
outside the usual zones of the world in a similar manor to the [](None_Coast.md).

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") in Sonorous Junk
Reef. This zone does not spawn [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps.

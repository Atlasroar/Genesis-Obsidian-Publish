Bark is the easternmost town in Kenshi, and is located near the base of
a large mountain. Nearby towns include [Heft](Heft_(Alpha).md "wikilink")
and [Black Scratch](Black_Scratch_(Alpha).md "wikilink"). It is apparently
owned by the [Imperial Lords](Imperial_Lords.md "wikilink"). Bark has
multiple unmarked buildings with beds and other amenities.

A town named [Bark](Bark.md "wikilink") made it into the final release of
the game. It is controlled by the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), a further development of Imperial
Lords faction.

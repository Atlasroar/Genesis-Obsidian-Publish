Different users have access to different functions of the site. While
anyone can do most things on the site, such as reading and editing,
**administrators** can access a few additional functions.

## Administrator abilities

These additional functions include:

- Deleting and undeleting pages, page histories, and uploaded files.
- Locking ([protecting]({{ns:project}}:Protected_page "wikilink")) a
  page so it cannot be edited or renamed by users without admin rights
  or autoconfirmed status.
- Blocking IP addresses or user names from editing; and very quick
  "rollback" of undesirable edits.
- Editing the interface by changing system messages and skins.

## Bureaucrat abilities

A **bureaucrat** can make other users into bureaucrats or administrators
on their own wiki.

Bureaucrats can also give users the ability to "rollback" edits not made
in [good faith](w:Assume_good_faith "wikilink").

## Staff

Wikia staff members have full access to all Wikia. They will be shown in
[Special:Listusers/staff](Special:Listusers/staff "wikilink") on any
wiki. Please use [Special:Contact](Special:Contact "wikilink") to
contact Wikia staff.

## How do I use administrator powers?

See [Help:Administrators' how-to
guide](Help:Administrators'_how-to_guide "wikilink") for a guide on
using admin functions.

## Becoming an administrator

For you to become an administrator, someone with bureaucrat access must
make you one. On larger Wikia, there will usually be a community page
for requests, with a page name such as "Kenshi Wiki:Requests for
adminship". On a smaller wiki, you may simply ask on the community
portal or [Forum](Forum:Index "wikilink"), or ask a bureaucrat directly
on their talk page.

If there are no active bureaucrats, use the "Requests for adminship"
page to nominate users to become admins or bureaucrats. Once a community
decision has been reached (or if there is no active community to debate
the decision), please leave a message at the [wiki adoption requests
page](Wikia:Wikia:Adoption_requests "wikilink") and Wikia Staff can
provide the rights.

## What can administrators not do?

Administrators should not use their administrator powers to settle
editing disputes; for example, to lock a page on a version which they
prefer in an editing dispute which doesn't involve vandalism.
Administrator powers should be used to help keep the wiki clear of
vandalism, spam, and users who make malicious edits, but not for simple
disagreements between users acting in [good
faith](w:Assume_good_faith "wikilink").

Ideally an admin shouldn't be considered "in charge". The ideal admin is
just someone who is trusted to have a few extra buttons and to use them
for the benefit of the Wikia community.

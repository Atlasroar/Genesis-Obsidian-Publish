**Flatskin**is a derogatory term used by characters in the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) to describe
[Humans](Human.md "wikilink"). It is used to describe the lack of horns
that play a significant part in [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") culture and/or
the lack of rough boneplates that cover most of Shek's skin.

Flatskin is a Word Swap used in Kenshi dialogue. As the player improves
relations with the Shek Kingdom, their title changes.

## Trivia

- As this word is a word swap in Kenshi dialogue, it may cause some odd
  instances (if the player isn't allied with the Shek Kingdom) where
  Shek Warriors will belittle the player character while using rather
  glorious titles such as the "slayer of the Bugmaster/Phoenix".

**Hydroponic Hemp** is a farming building which grows
[Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink"). It can be constructed after researching
[Hydroponic Hemp](Hydroponics_(Tech).md "wikilink"). This building uses and
levels characters' [Farming](Farming.md "wikilink") stat. It requires
inputs of [Power](Power.md "wikilink") (10 used)
and [Water](Water.md "wikilink") to grow.

Despite being an "indoor only"
placement, [Hydroponics](Hydroponics.md "wikilink") can be placed on the
roofs of buildings.

Hydroponic Hemp farms can be found inside the buildings in [](Secret_Drug_Farm.md).

## Tips

- If used to create [biofuel](Fuel.md "wikilink"), it can be grown
  self-sufficiently.

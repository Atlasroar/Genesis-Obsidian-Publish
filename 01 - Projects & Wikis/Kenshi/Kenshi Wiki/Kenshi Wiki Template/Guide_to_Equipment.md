Wearing [Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") and having
a [Weapon](Weapons.md "wikilink") is essential in order to win fights early
on.

## Weapons

Characters have two weapon slots named "Weapon 1" and "Weapon 2". The
top slot can contain two small weapons. The topmost weapon will be used,
unless the character is experiencing debuffs. Personal debuffs would be
using a [Heavy Weapon](Heavy_Weapons.md "wikilink") while in a building, or
losing an arm. Because every weapon requires the right arm-there are
**no** "One-handed weapons". In a similar manner, martial arts is
disabled if the limbs required for certain attacks are below 0 health.
Heavy weapons, crossbows and polearms require both arms to be healthy,
or splinted above 0 HP.

### Weapon Selection

Certain weapons are better (or worse) depending on who you are fighting,
what they are wearing, and where the battle is happening.

- Will be swung very slowly, if the person lacks the strength to use
  them. (Blunt damage x 40 is req strength)
- More damage when you have levels in a specific [](Statistics.md#Melee).
- Consider armor penetration against armored enemies or cutting weapons
  against unarmored fighters.
- Some weapons have specific race-based damage (i.e. Polearms doing more
  to animals, Falling Sun doing more to Gorillos, Flesh Cleaver does
  more damage to all humanoid non-robots).
- Some have a indoors penalty which reduces both their Melee Attack and
  Defense when used in a building.
- Some have +[Melee Attack](Melee_Attack.md "wikilink"), which can allow
  characters with lower stats to hit more skilled fighters.
- Some weapons more reach than others which when swung can whack
  multiple enemies at once.
- Weapon damage when hitting is based on your statistics for
  [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"), [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink"),
  and your skill for the weapon class.[^1] This is multiplied by the
  weapon quality. So, you can expect a new recruit with high strength,
  but low dexterity to be better with any kind of blunt weapons.
  Dexterity and strength will also drop when your person takes moderate
  chest and stomach damage.
- Katanas have a double strike animation, this is a twentyish percent
  chance to strike twice with a katana. This special animation comes at
  the cost at having less AOE than other weapons.

### Combat Styles

One approach is to ensure your squad has a diverse array of wielded
weapons to counter enemy defenses and find ways to syncronize attacks. A
staggering blow from a heavy weapon provides openings for fast attackers
to hit several in a row.

Additionally, it is wise to include a backup weapon that trains a
supplementary skill (i.e. blunt armor penetration from a Spiked Club
while you use a Katana as your main). Generally, having an
armor-penetrating weapon (either primary or secondary) is advantageous
for a few lategame enemies which have decent quality armor.

### Weapon Weight

In order to swing the weapon at normal speed it is recommended that
characters have a [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") greater than forty
times the blunt damage of the weapon in the case of injuries.

### Weapon Reach

Weapons like the [Wakizashi](Wakizashi.md "wikilink") require the person to
stand closer to the target before swinging.
[Polearms](Polearms.md "wikilink") and [](Heavy_Weapons.md), have a much longer reach.

## Armour

[Light Armour](Body_Armour.md#Light_Armour "wikilink"), [](Body_Armour.md#Medium_Armour), and [](Body_Armour.md#Heavy_Armour) can be mixed based on need.
Lighter armors like [Assassin's Rags](Assassin's_Rags.md "wikilink") are
selected for the buff to [Statistics](Statistics.md "wikilink"). Heavier
armors won't have these buffs. The heaviest armor can be worn without
training, but the weight (or [Encumbrance](Encumbrance.md "wikilink")) of
your armor and equipment will cause a penalty to run speed and your
dodge statistic. If you Encumbrance is over 0% then your combat speed is
also reduced.

### Basic Details

- **Weight**: The weight of the armour.
- **Coverage**: Percentages of armour coverage on
  [Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") display how likely they are to mitigate
  damage taken on that part of the blocking character's body.
- **Skills**: Multiplier applied to the skill of the wearer
- **Armor Layer** have an order on which gets calculated first starting
  from: Head, Armour, Pants, Shirt, and then Boots. If there is a
  multiple different armour that covers the same spot, the damage
  reduction will be continued to the next layer if its coverage applies.
  - Damage converted by cut resistance efficiency ignores the layers.
- **Quality**ordered from \[Prototype\], \[Shoddy\], \[Standard\],
  \[High\], \[Specialist\], and \[Masterwork\], corresponding to
  Gear_Prototype, Gear_Cheap, Gear_Standard, Gear_Good, Great_Quality
  and Gear_Master in the [FCS](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md "wikilink").

### Damage Resistances

A more detailed explanation about the way which
[Damage](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Damage.md "wikilink") resistance is calculated can be found on the
page [Resistances](Resistances.md "wikilink").

- **Blunt Resistance**: Reduce the blunt damage received by flat
  percentage.
- **Cut Resistance**: Reduces the cut damage received by the flat
  percentage.
- **Cut Resistance Efficiency**: The percentage of "resisted" cut damage
  that gets completely negated. The rest of the "resisted" cut damage is
  transformed into stun damage.
- **Harpoon Resistance**: The amount of harpoon damage which will go
  through the cut resistance/effiency of the armour. Note that unlike
  cut resist the harpoon damage that is not mitigated doesn't actually
  damage you. Once you get through the Harpoon resistance though you
  take unmitigated cut damage.

### Weather Coverage

More information about equipment with weather protection can be found on
the [Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") page.

- **Duststorm**: Reduces the stat penalty effect of the dust storm.
- **Acid**: Reduces the damage received from acid rain.
- **Burning**: Reduces damage received from beams in
  [Venge](Venge.md "wikilink").
- **Gas**: Reduces damage received from clouds of poison gas in the
  Black Desert and Ashlands.

### Racial Armour Restrictions

Humans and Shek characters have armour slots for
[Headgear](Headgear.md "wikilink"), [Shirts](Shirts.md "wikilink"), [](Body_Armour.md), [Legwear](Legwear.md "wikilink"), and
[Footwear](Footwear.md "wikilink"). Skeletons and Hive Soldiers only have
general slots for Body Armour and Legwear. There are Hive shirts which
are both only wearable by hivers and the only shirts which hivers can
wear. Hive Workers and Hive Princes can wear Headgear as well as Body
Armour and Legwear. However there are a few helmets which Hiver Workers,
Princes and Sheks are unable to wear.

### Example

- Assume a character wears a \[Masterwork\] [](Samurai_Armour.md). With 81.25% cut resistance and 90%
  cut resistance efficiency.
- When you receive 100 cut damage, the armour will **resist** the cut
  damage by 81.25%, meaning you will only take 18.75 cut damage, because
  18.75% of the damage isn't resisted.
- The blocked 81.25 damage will then be converted by the **cut
  resistance efficiency** and you will receive 8.125 blunt damage
  additionally because 10% of resisted damage isn't nullified completely
  due the the efficiency.
- Assume the next **layer** hit is your \[Masterwork\] [](Leather_Turtleneck.md) with 33.44% cut resistance
  and 50% cut resistance efficiency.
  - The next layer will reduce the remaining 18.75 cut damage from the
    previous resistance. It turns the 18.75 cut damage into 12.48 cut
    (18.75 x 0.6656) and the 6.27 resisted damage becomes 3.135 (6.27 x
    0.5).
- The final damage received totals 12.48 Cut damage and 11.26 (8.125 +
  3.135) blunt damage.

## Backpacks

See [Backpacks](Backpacks.md "wikilink"). The reader should note which
stats are debuffed when wearing the pack.

- "Combat Skills' - A direct subtraction to your success chance: [](Melee_Attack.md) and [](Melee_Defense.md).
- Combat speed - You're slower at attacking and blocking in combat.
- Stealth and dodge - See [Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink") and
  [Dodge](Dodge.md "wikilink").

Newer players might bring up the [statistics
page](:File:Riddly_Stats.jpg "wikilink") for their character, as a guide
for whom to fight. This is a mistake. Instead look at the Melee attack
in the sidebar. This shows your *current* statistics, not the raw ones.
[Encumbrance](Encumbrance.md "wikilink") is yet another stat and you should
be careful not to fight if it's too high as it gives you a penalty to
combat speed, dodge and movement speed. Also be warned that if you drop
your stolen backpack while you are inside a store, then it may be a
crime to pick it up again.

## Crossbows

See [Crossbows](Crossbows.md "wikilink").

- Tier 1: [Junkbow](Junkbow.md "wikilink") and [](Tooth_Pick.md).
- Tier 2: Crossbows using [Regular bolts](Bolts_Regulars.md "wikilink")
  ([Ranger](Ranger.md "wikilink"), [](Oldworld_Bow_MkI.md), [](Oldworld_Bow_MkII.md)), [](Bolts_Heavies.md) ([](Spring_Bat.md)), or [Long bolts](Bolts_Longs.md "wikilink")
  ([Eagle's Cross](Eagle's_Cross.md "wikilink")).

According to the weapon stats[^5], any crossbow in the second tier does
about the same amount of damage per second. However, the quality
modifiers- Shoddy to Masterwork, have a major effect. But you don't need
damage output to use crossbows. Every crossbow staggers an enemy, every
time. It also causes bleed damage. And raw DPS doesn't make much
difference when the enemy has armours that block a set amount of damage
from each bolt. That is, if your bow does 60 damage, and the enemy has
32 harpoon resistance armour, then every shot will do about 28 cut
damage along with the stun damage taken from the armour reducing damage
taken. You have a crossbow stat, and this applies to the 'skill
required' listed on the crossbow itself.

**Port North**Â is a town controlled by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md). Despite being called a "port," this
town is essentially a [Stone Camp](Stone_Camp.md "wikilink") because it
contains many [stone mines](Stone_Mine.md "wikilink") and raw materials
processing industries. It likely produces [](Iron_Plates.md) and [](Building_Materials.md) for export. [](Lady_Kana.md) lives here in a [](Noble_House.md), surrounded by her hooded [](Empire_Noble_Guard_Hooded.md). You can find this town by
venturing to "middle" of the northern seashore of [](The_Great_Desert.md) or by acquiring and reading the
**[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the United Cities (Central Territories)**.

Although all the industrial machineries her only includes
[Stone](Raw_Stone.md "wikilink") and [Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink")-related
products, it is said by **Lady Kana** that this slave camp is the
biggest 'Slave Farm' and also a producer of
[clothings](Clothing.md "wikilink"). Therefore, it is likely that the
industrial buildings resource output should not be taken literally as
their export of commodities.

Despite featuring buildings labeled "[](Slaver_Bar.md)" there are no barman in this town to trade
with.

There is also another "port" in **The Great Desert,** called [](Port_South.md) and it is controlled by [](Slave_Master_Wada.md).

## Trivia

Designation of this town as a "port" that actually features a usable
harbour is yet another indication that the world of
[Kenshi](World_of_Kenshi.md "wikilink") used to have maritime transport.
Shipment of raw materials produced on site over the sea would have been
more practical and convenient than using desert caravans. Other
indications that Kenshi used to have some form of ships are their
carcasses scattered in some zones and an occasional monologue that
[Skeleton](Skeleton_(Race).md "wikilink") characters would utter upon
entering [the Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink").

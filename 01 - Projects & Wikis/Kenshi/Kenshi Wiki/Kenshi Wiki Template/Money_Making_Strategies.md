Throughout the game, you will find that having money, or
[Cats](Cats.md "wikilink"), is convenient in order to survive in the
dangerous world of Kenshi. Here are just a few helpful tips and methods
of getting rich in this apocalyptic desert.

You may want to think about your future plans when deciding what
strategies to employ. If you have no plans on making a base, then you
may want to avoid strategies that involve laboring or crafting since you
will most likely not be able to take advantage of the skills gained
doing this, but concentrating on strategies such as looting or trade
will benefit you through more combat exposure and athletics and strength
training from all that running with lots of looted or trade goods.

## Finding Places to Sell

First things first, you need a place to sell your stuff. Given
shopkeepers only have so much money to purchase your wares, it's good to
have a plan of where you're going to sell your items. In general, it's a
good idea to have a base positioned near enough to Towns/outposts so
that you don't spend too long on the road. The area around the Hub is
great for trading early game since it is relatively close to many towns.
Note also that [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") villages have a
[Robotics Shop](Robotics_Shop.md "wikilink") and a Trade Goods Trader,
making them prime places to sell your wares if you do not mind visiting
multiple places. The Hive Trader has a 6 hour refresh time meaning that
6 hours after the shop was loaded in the will restock their inventory
and cats.

## Low-Risk Strategies

Buying and reselling [Trade Goods](Trade_Goods.md "wikilink") or
[Crafting](Crafting.md "wikilink") materials to sell can be difficult early
game. Players often start out with very few Cats. These strategies
should be helpful to new players.

### Looting

Early on, player characters will not win fights. The prevalent strategy
to make up for this is luring hostile squads towards a [](Major_Towns.md). After the guards knock all of the
combatants unconscious, player characters should loot the downed
characters. To save on inventory space, players should prioritize
looting the more valuable items from these characters instead of just
stripping them dry. Since the attacking squad was likely members of a
[Hostile Faction](Hostile_Factions.md "wikilink"), all vendors should
accept items stolen from them. Players should be able to make a few
thousand cats off each group. If your inventory becomes full you can
pickup a knocked out bandit and store items in their inventory to sell
in a shop in town.

Players should lure bandits or wildlife to the town guards for slaughter
and looting until the player can afford good equipment. Fighting
alongside the guards can be a relatively safe way to train your attack
as if hit you simply need to retreat and the guards should keep the
other hostiles off you.

### Looting in [Bast](Bast.md "wikilink")

[Bast](Bast.md "wikilink") has many large [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) patrols that fight each other whenever
they meet. Wait until all of one side is down to avoid committing a
crime and getting attacked and then loot their stuff.
[Drin](Drin.md "wikilink") in the north-east of [Bast](Bast.md "wikilink") has
a bar so you can sell some gear and buy some [Food](Food.md "wikilink")
before you have to travel to a town. Since [Drin](Drin.md "wikilink") and
the nearest towns are [UC](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), it's best to loot
[HN](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") gear, so you don't have to worry about
selling stolen goods. This isn't much of a problem as
[UC](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") patrols usually win.

Once the bartender in [Drin](Drin.md "wikilink") has run out of money,
avoid the [skimmers](Skimmer.md "wikilink") on the run over to
[Stoat](Stoat.md "wikilink") or [Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink") to sell
the rest, find new recruits and buy backpacks and pack animals so you
can go back and carry even more stuff. One good thing to do early is pay
c.10,000 to join the [Shinobi Thieves](Shinobi_Thieves.md "wikilink") in
[Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink") to purchase [](Thieves_Backpack.md) and other gear from them at the
50% members discount.

The best is when [HN](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") patrols attack
[Drin](Drin.md "wikilink") itself, as they commit a crime-fighting there
and accrue a bounty of (Assault) c.500. In addition, each time they
recover and start fighting again, the bounty goes up by another c.500.
So, a [Paladin](Paladin.md "wikilink") can get up to a bounty of c.1,500
that way. There are two [prisoner cages](Prisoner_Cage.md "wikilink") on
top of a building in [Drin](Drin.md "wikilink"), and if they are empty, all
you have to do is put them in a cage and automatically get the bounty
before having to go to a [police station](Police_Station.md "wikilink") in
town. If injured too badly for whatever reason you can use the beds in
Drin for free.

Since dead bounties only give you half the monetary reward, you'll want
to heal them before a desert crossing to the [](Police_Station.md) at either [Stoat](Stoat.md "wikilink")
or [Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink"). Fortunately, you'll have looted
plenty of [](Basic_First_Aid_Kits_(Tech).md). So, in addition to the
relation bonus with [UC](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") for turning in
bounties, you will eventually get some small relationship bonuses with
the [HN](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") from healing up the bounties you
are turning in. Bounty collection gives a relationship penalty that is
much higher than the reward for healing. You can heal many people with
looted bandages and turn in only a few if you want to maintain neutral
relationships. Carrying people is also a great exercise that increases
your [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") if encumbered.

Avoid wearing any looted gear which has the faction uniform tag as
members of that faction may see through your
[Disguise](Disguise.md "wikilink") and other factions may be tricked by it
which wil also lead to being attacked. Also, you can use any bounties
you are carrying as extra inventory space by giving them looted items.
"Stolen" gear should lose its status when placed in a specialized
container (Armour storage for clothes/armour for example, or Crossbow
locker for all items). You can use this to sell items back to a faction
which previously owned them.

### Mining Deposits

Across Kenshi, there are Iron and Copper deposits. Iron deposits can be
ignored because [Raw Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink") is worth half as much as
[Raw Copper](Raw_Copper.md "wikilink"). Mining either is inferior to almost
every other money making method but can be done without needing to be
actively playing. These ore deposits can be used by 1 to 3 workers,
depending on the size of the deposit. Characters can be given mining
jobs by shift-left-clicking the deposit. Each deposit will stack only
five items before it is full, and workers will stop working. If these
miners were assigned a Job, they would resume it as soon as the
extracted copper is transferred to their inventories. It's a good idea
to use a stacking [Backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") to transport the
copper as backpacks decrease encumbrance while worn and greatly increase
the carrying capacity of characters.

Mining characters should not be left alone since these deposits are in
the wilderness, and workers are left exposed to attacks by wild animals
and [Hostile Factions](Hostile_Factions.md "wikilink"). If they are
attacked, players should quickly move their backpacks to their primary
inventory or simply drop them on the ground. This is recommended because
backpacks can lower melee combat stats by up to 10, depending on the
type of backpack (note, the [](Small_Thieves_Backpack.md) provides no penalty).

Players should find a town that has a price markup on copper higher than
100%, then find the nearest copper deposit of reasonable quality,
preferably 100. Players should mine as much copper as they can and sell
it to the town's trader. This method will increase the characters'
[Labouring](Labouring.md "wikilink") and [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink")
stats due to their mining and carrying large amounts of copper.

If players want to take a further step of copper mining, the player
should research [](Electrical_Crafting_(Tech).md) and build an
[Electrical Workbench](Electrical_Workbench.md "wikilink") next or near
your copper storage and put a worker on the workbench. The ratio is 1:1,
1 Raw Copper for 1 [](Electrical_Components.md), which nets around 40 cats
extra (216) per component, and it also trains the Science skill.
However, it needs a power source.

### Wandering Traders

This requires a bit of capital to get started. Players should find the
[Trader](Traders.md "wikilink") in their starting location and buy up
whichever [Trade Goods](Trade_Goods.md "wikilink") items have low markups
until they run out of Cats. They should then head to next nearest town
and sell whatever they can make a profit on. Players should next buy up
the cheapest items again and proceed to either the previous location or
a different one. Players can repeat this until they can purchase quality
equipment and move on to fighting or until they can afford to build a
Player Outpost where they can [Craft](Crafting.md "wikilink") items for
trading. Important to add that markup will not change by a massive
amount over short distances and for the best markup changes travel far.
(If you go from Stack to Bad Teeth the markups will not change by much
on items purchased, but from Stack to Heng the markups will (On average)
change by a lot)

### Manufacturing

Through [Industry Buildings](Industry_Buildings.md "wikilink"), players can
give character's jobs to create [](Outpost_Items.md), which are worth more than their
unrefined ingredients. These [Buildings](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") are
primarily exterior-type buildings, meaning that they cannot be built in
[](Player-Owned_Buildings_in_Town.md).

Players can also manufacture vices such as [Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink")
and Alcohol. These buildings are listed on the
[Crafting](Crafting.md "wikilink") page along with their primary inputs.
Hashish production requires rarer [](Research_Artifacts.md), and selling Hashish is
covered in the "High-Risk Strategies" section of this guide.

### Crafting

[Crafting](Crafting.md "wikilink") weapons and armor can be an efficient
way to make money. While very profitable, weapon crafting can takes a
lot of [Technology](Technology.md "wikilink") research, [](Research_Artifacts.md), and
[Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink") to really pop off. If the player has
already set up their outpost for the production of their own
[equipment](Equipment.md "wikilink"), it can provide some great revenue.
Once players have reliable sources of [Raw Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink"),
[Iron Plates](Iron_Plate.md "wikilink"), [](Steel_Bars.md), [Fabrics](Fabrics.md "wikilink"), and
[Leather](Leather.md "wikilink"), it is worth assigning a full-time
machinist to both trainntheir skills, and eventually produce profitable
items.

While it will take some time to get an [](Armour_Smith.md) who can consistently produce quality
goods, one of the cheapest, quickest, and easiest items to mass-produce
for sale is the [Bandana](Bandana.md "wikilink"). Quick and straightforward
to make, its Standard grade sells for c.175. This number will increase
significantly with a more experienced craftsperson; at the Specialist
Grade, a simple Bandana (regardless of color) costs 0.4 fabric to make
and sells for c.692 per unit. So to make 10 it would cost you 4 fabrics
(c.252 average on total) and you would receive
c.60/c.460/c1,750/c.3,910/c.6,920/c.9,750
(Proto/Shoddy/Standard/High/Specialist/Masterwork) worth of bandanas.
Once you reach around level 40ish Armoursmithing you should
purchase/find an Engineering Research (Purchase from Scraphouse for
c.8,000) and pivot to crafting [](Heart_Protector.md)s. They are the best crafting
money maker in the game. They take a little over 3x longer to craft when
compared to Bandanas but have well over 3x the profits that they provide
as well as taking longer to fill up your storage boxes.

For players hoping to profit off of [](Weapon_Smith.md), [](Desert_Sabre.md) are highly recommended. It costs c.675
to craft each one at a Weaponsmithing 1 table and sells for c.942 at the
lowest quality, meaning you are able to make a profit right at the
start. The blueprint is rather expensive however at c.12,000 and can be
found at (Weaponshops mostly) Shark's Smithy, Mongrel, Unities Cities
and the Scraphouse.

[Crossbow Smithing](Crossbow_Smith.md "wikilink") is the least recommended
branch of equipment crafting. The easiest, least tedious
[Crossbow](Crossbows.md "wikilink") to produce is the
[Junkbow](Junkbow.md "wikilink"), which, at specialist grade, sells for
c.1004. That said, it requires a [Hinge](Hinge.md "wikilink"), [](Steel_Bars.md), and 10 hours to produce it, making it a
bit more tedious than standard weapons crafting. The other crossbow
models sell a little to significantly better, based upon quality;
however, they also require [Crossbow Parts](Crossbow_Parts.md "wikilink"),
which need more subsequent parts to craft, increasing time crafting
spent per item. In general, you're better off with armor or even weapons
smithing. The only real reason to train a character in Crossbow Smithing
is if you need a lot of ammunition.

### Alcohol Trade Route

​This trade route has three stops; it's a trade route I discovered
myself, which has proven to be very profitable as I accumulated (on
average) 7000 Cats after just one full rotation. First, go to the Hub
and begin purchasing as much Cactus Rum as you can. Next, travel into
the swamps and sell all of it to the swampers. Then, buy Sake and head
toward the United Cities; keep in mind that there is a possibility of
getting stopped by corrupt patrols and guards. Unload all of the Sake
and load up on Grog. Then trek back to the Hub and sell it all. After
about an hour of repeating this process, I had made quite a profit.

### Hashish Trading

One way to better make money from Hashish that isn't illegal. Is simply
to take a mountain of drugs (or however many you buy) from Shark (and
the surrounding swamp villages) and selling it to the Tech Hunter's
Settlements of Mourn and Flats Lagoon (Other settlements do work, yet
these are closest). After making the slightly dangerous journey of
avoiding Swamp Ninjas, Blood Spiders, and most importantly, Beak Things.
You'll be quickly swimming in cats.

Hashish and alcohol trading can be combined into a single trade route
going counter-clockwise around central Kenshi. Starting at [](Blister_Hill.md), go through Holy Nation cities buying any
[Bloodrum](Bloodrum.md "wikilink") you can find. Then head to
[Squin](Squin.md "wikilink") and the [](Waystation_(Stenn_Desert).md) and buy [](Cactus_Rum.md), then go through to the towns in [](The_Swamp.md) selling the Cactus Rum and buying
[Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink") and [Sake](Sake.md "wikilink"). Take your
preferred route to [Flats Lagoon](Flats_Lagoon.md "wikilink"), unload the
Hashish and buy more Sake, then head north to the [](Waystation_(Grey_Desert).md) and buy their Sake as
well. Head over to [Heng](Heng.md "wikilink"), sell the Bloodrum to the
[Shinobi Thieves](Shinobi_Thieves.md "wikilink") and the Sake to the bars,
buy more Cactus Rum, then head west back to Blister Hill through
[Okran's Shield](Okran's_Shield.md "wikilink") to start the cycle again.
(If you don't want to smuggle the Bloodrum, take a detour to the
[Smugglers Bar](Smugglers_Bar.md "wikilink") during the Swamp-Flats Lagoon
leg and sell it there instead.) [Grog](Grog.md "wikilink") has no special
discounts/premiums from [](Traders.md#Trade_Cultures), so buy it from whomever
sells cheap and sell it to whomever buys dear along the way (if you have
the free space – always prioritize goods with better profit margins).
For best results, use a trader with enough
[Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") and [Athletics](Athletics.md "wikilink") to
run at over 22 mph while carrying a teammate holding the goods in
backpacks; this will let you trade a maximum amount of goods and smuggle
with impunity while still being able to outrun any problem that isn't a
Beak Thing.

## High-Risk Strategies

These strategies primarily involve either crime against
[Factions](Factions.md "wikilink") or attacking a [](Hostile_Factions.md).

### Stealing

Stealing valuable items can be preferable to purchasing them, especially
when players can't afford the items to begin with. Items that are
recommended for stealing and reselling are blueprints and alcohol. Most
valuable items are kept inside locked [Storage](Storage.md "wikilink")
containers, so this method will require training
[Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink"), [Thievery](Thievery.md "wikilink"),
and [Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink"). The single best place to steal from
is the Bank in [Trader's Edge](Trader's_Edge.md "wikilink"). Stolen items
can be cleared by placing them in a specialized container or an Item
Furnace/Crossbow Locker. They can then be sold at full price. 

A more in-depth guide to thieving for new players can be found on the
page [Getting Started](Getting_Started.md "wikilink"). 

### Smuggling

After joining the [Shinobi Thieves](Shinobi_Thieves.md "wikilink"),
characters can sell smuggled goods to a [](Shinobi_Trader.md). While several items are illegal in
Kenshi, the most reliable item to smuggle is
[Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink"). Hashish can be purchased from most town
in [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"), primarily from [](Fish_and_Drugs_Seller.md). The Shinobi Trader only buy
at half the local price. This means that in [Heft](Heft.md "wikilink"),
[Heng](Heng.md "wikilink") and [Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink"), where
Hashish has a 1200% illegal goods markup, Shinobi Trader will purchase
Hashish at 600% markup. No other vendor will buy illicit goods.

Players can risk being caught carrying illegal items by town guards, or
they can put all unlawful things into a [Backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink")
and hold the backpack in their regular inventory.

### Looting Ancient Locations

If players want to advance the buildings in their Outposts, they are
going to need [Research Artifacts](Research_Artifacts.md "wikilink") to
study. Strategies for clearing the dangers in the locations in which
these Artifacts are found can be learned in our [](Combat_Strategies.md) page.

[Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink") contain more than just Artifacts
and can be extremely profitable. It is recommended that players bring
multiple stacking backpacks or an animal player character with a
backpack to collect all the items in storage.

Once you're all kitted out, head over to an Ancient location of your
choice and proceed to take everything that isn't nailed down. Though
prices may vary, based on where you sell your loot, many ruins have a
several valuable [Robotics Components](Robotics_Components.md "wikilink"),
and other similar, valuable items. [CPU Units](CPU_Unit.md "wikilink") are
worth 6,000 Cats, Robotics Components 2,838 Cats, [](Power_Core.md) 3,000 Cats, and [](Skeleton_Repair_Kit.md) 4,341 Cats; all of these items
(and more) can be found in various Ruins scattered across the continent.

From only looting the [Skeleton Muscles](Skeleton_Muscle.md "wikilink") off
of the [Security Spiders](Security_Spider.md "wikilink"), players can earn
roughly 1,944 Cats per muscle. There will likely be 6 Security Spiders
per [Lost Armoury](Lost_Armoury.md "wikilink"). [](Ancient_Tech_Lab.md) can contain anywhere from 6 to 14
Spiders as well as more Skeleton Muscles inside of Storage Containers.

### Bounty Hunting

Characters with high bounties can be learned through their [](Wanted_Posters.md). These characters are often leaders
of [Hostile Factions](Hostile_Factions.md "wikilink") and will be
surrounded by a group of relatively strong characters protecting them.
Knocking them unconscious or picking them up while they are sleeping
should not be difficult for skilled fighters or a character with very
high [Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink"). Bounties can also be found among
randomly generated among characters such as Grass Pirates and Empire
Peasants. Turning in a dead body for bounties will still reward you half
the original amount.

### Fog Prince Head Hunting

Due to the danger of being downed in the [](Fog_Islands.md), it isn't recommended for early game
squads to hunt [Fog Deathyards](Fog_Deathyard.md "wikilink"). However,
[Fogmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") frequently attack the city of
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"). Mongrel's Shinobi Guards are more than
capable of defending the town. Before being defeated, [](Fog_Prince.md) usually reach the Mongrel Barracks;
however, some Princes can be defeated before even entering the city
gates. Fog Princes can be difficult to spot in large piles of Fogmen,
but their distinct yellow blood helps.

Fog Princes don't seem to be attracted to the Mongrel Barrack's
prisoners anymore. However, Fog Princes can still be a good source of
income for players with good [Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink") and
[Assassination](Assassination.md "wikilink"). Players can sneak into a Fog
Deathyard, assassinate a [Fogman](Fogman.md "wikilink"), pick them up, and
put them on a Prisoner Pole to attract a Fog Prince. It may take a while
for a Prince to arrive, but players who are within the dialogue range of
the Fog Deathyard can quickly tell when feeding is happening. Players
should sneak back to the Deathyard and stealth KO the Fog Prince. Often,
a failed attempt does not alert fogmen because the desire to feed and
worship is too strong.

After looting their heads from their bodies, the bounties can be earned
by merely selling the heads to any vendor. A [](Fog_Prince_Head.md) is worth 6,000 Cats.

### Leviathan Pearl Factory

[Leviathans](Leviathan.md "wikilink") are arguably the most tanky enemy in
the game and possess devastating attacks, AoE, high health regen, and
massive hit points. Even well-equipped, high-level squads can be
devastated. However, each body drops one [](Leviathan_Pearl.md) worth 12,000 Cats. There are a few
strategies for hunting these beasts:

- Early on you can build a base in the [](Leviathan_Coast.md). With several wall-mounted turrets
  facing the gate in a U shape, you can quickly take them down (and
  train your Turret skill).
- Younger leviathans drop the same pearl but are significantly weaker,
  less tanky, and slower and are therefore recommended as prey.
- If you have a source of iron and can make crossbow bolts, you can
  attack with long-range crossbows taking advantage of the slow movement
  speed of leviathans. Their slow speed and high hit points make this a
  good way to train crossbows, but their high health regeneration rate
  may make this very time-consuming.

### Raid Animal Nests

[Beak Thing Eggs](Beak_Thing_Egg.md "wikilink") are worth a good amount of
money, c.4,200 each. They can be found in a [](Nest_of_Beak_Things.md), which spawns randomly in many
zones. Players can easily send in fast or stealthy characters to pick
the eggs up off the ground and run from the nest. It is not recommended
that players, especially in the early game, attempt to kill the [](Beak_Thing.md) before looting the eggs. Note that Beak
Things will eat your knocked out characters, even if they're still
alive. Players should ensure their characters are prepared in the
following ways:

- [Athletics](Athletics.md "wikilink"): High athletics makes it much easier
  to get away from Beak Things, but most characters are going to be
  slower than a Beak Thing. However, the Beak Thing attack animation is
  very slow and can easily be kited, allowing you to get away.
- [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink"): Beak Thing Eggs weigh 6kg each. A
  full inventory (4 eggs) weighs 24kg.
- [Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink"): Players can attempt to sneak into and
  out of the camp undetected. It is recommended that players sneak into
  the Nest at night to aid in this.
- [Equipment](Equipment.md "wikilink"): Players should equip their
  characters with [Backpacks](Backpacks.md "wikilink") to carry more eggs
  and reduce encumbrance. Characters should consider wearing [](Wooden_Sandals.md) to boost their athletics, as well.
  A character with a single [Scout Leg](Robot_Limbs.md "wikilink") is
  significantly faster than a character with normal legs. If players are
  attempting to use stealth, wearing stealth boosting equipment (such as
  [Ninja Rags](Ninja_Rags.md "wikilink") or [](Dark_Leather_Shirt.md)) is helpful. Note that [](Thieves_Backpack.md) are especially useful here, as
  they do not penalize the Stealth skill.

[Crab Eggs](Crab_Egg.md "wikilink") can be raided in the same way but would
earn significantly less money. Collecting just 10 [](Beak_Thing_Egg.md) in one raid can earn players c.42,000.
Sneak in, steal their unhatched children, sneak out, and run like angry
dinosaurs are going to eat you for stealing their babies if they spot
you. Because there will be, try at your own risk.

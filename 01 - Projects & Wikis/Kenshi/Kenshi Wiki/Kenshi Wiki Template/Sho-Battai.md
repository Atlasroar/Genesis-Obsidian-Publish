**Sho-Battai** is a [Major Town](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") located in the
middle of [The Great Desert](The_Great_Desert.md "wikilink") region. This
town is presided over by the noble [](Lord_Nagata.md). Its economy relies solely on the
supplies from [Port North](Port_North.md "wikilink"). It can be discovered
by travelling near or by acquiring and reading the
**[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the United Cities (Central Territories)** or
**Map of the United Cities (Extended Territories).**

At the 'backyard' of this town, a unique [](Sho-Battai_Headgear_Shop.md) can be found, alongside 2
power stations and several camp beds. The latter are most likely slums
for the homeless to sleep constructed by the government or
[peasants](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md "wikilink") themselves. This town is
noteworthy for both the only Headgear shop in the entire UC, and a
Thieves Guild where the player could buy some sneaky equipments.

Some unique companions who spawn in this town are
[Riddly](Riddly.md "wikilink"), [Jewel](Jewel.md "wikilink") and
[Izumi](Izumi.md "wikilink") which can be often found in one of the bars or
the [bakery](Empire_Bakery.md "wikilink"). Checking by the outhouses might
yield another unique recruit - [Ells](Ells.md "wikilink").

There is always at least one squad of [](United_Heroes_League.md) members set to spawn here, and
may harass your non-human squad if seen by them.

You can start the game in Sho-Battai with the "Empire Citizen" [](Game_Starts.md). The "Rock Bottom" game start has you
spawning in the desert east of the city.

## Trivia

- **Sho-Battai** is the only town that can be found in both extended and
  central territory maps of UC.
- Like with most other "Prosperous" town overrides in
  [FCS](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md "wikilink"), the name seems to be
  misleading. The town appears to have an even lower quality of life
  than before the override. The title "Prosperous" may simply be
  relative to other Town Overrides that can happen to this town.

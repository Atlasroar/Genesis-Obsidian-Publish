**The Elder**is the leader of the [](Skeleton_Bandits.md) faction. Talking to him at [](Iron_HQ.md) allows you to join his faction regardless of
race with the right dialogue choices.

He is also notable for his [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink")-grade [](Ringed_Sabre.md) as well as a valuable [](AI%20Core.md).

## Stats

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If **The Elder**is killed or imprisoned, it will cause the Iron HQ to be
taken over by the [Southern Hive](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink").
Furthermore, the patrols of Skeleton Bandits in the areas surrounding
[The Crags](The_Crags.md "wikilink") that once consisted of an [](Upgraded_Skeleton_Bandit.md) and 10-15
[Skeleton Bandits](Skeleton_Bandit.md "wikilink") become broken, turning to
a small squad of 1-5 [](Broken_Skeleton_Bandit.md).

If [Savant](Savant.md "wikilink") is alive and free while **The Elder** is
killed/imprisoned, it will cause [Skin Bandits](Skin_Bandits.md "wikilink")
patrols of 8-20 individuals to start patrolling in [](The_Pits.md) and [The Crags](The_Crags.md "wikilink").

The smaller Skeleton Bandit presence in the area also cause patrols of
Southern Hive consisting of a [Prince](Prince.md "wikilink") and 8
[Droneguards](Droneguard.md "wikilink") to start appearing in [](Stobe's_Garden.md) and [](The_Crags.md).

## Tips

- Looting the [AI Core](AI%20Core.md "wikilink") from Elder's inventory will
  immediately kill him.

## Trivia

- Elder is the only NPC who has an AI Core as a death item that is
  counted as "stolen" when looted.
- As Elder has his stealth category level set to 10, his Dexterity is
  only 10 as well. If he had no stealth stat set, his Dexterity would be
  75.

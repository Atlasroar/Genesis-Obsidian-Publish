**Expedition 4** is a ruined town built and abandoned by the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md). There are lots of items on ground in
and around the ruined buildings. Unlike most ruins, this location
actually has a working wind generator.

This location is referenced in [](Tech_Hunter's_Notes_Series.md). In many ways, it is
similar to the [Expedition 5](Expedition_5.md "wikilink") location.
Although the number implicates that there were 3 expedition before it,
it is however, not (at least explicitly) stated in the game what the
results of those expeditions were.

**Crossbows** are Kenshi's only ranged [Weapons](Weapons.md "wikilink")
that can be carried. To use a crossbow, equip the crossbow, make sure
that the character has the correct ammunition in their inventory, and
ensure that RANGED is active under JOBS.

Crossbows can do a decent amount of damage and cause significant
bleeding. It is important to note that the size of the target (and its
hitbox) plays an important role in the accuracy of crossbows. As such,
large animals are easier to hit than humanoids, which are in turn much
easier to hit than spiders. It is not rare for high-powered crossbows to
kill weaker enemies, ***and allies***, outright.

NOTE: There is an intentional mechanic from the developers that makes
all faction leaders are 'immune' to crossbows. Attempting to shoot units
with Diplomatic status will usually result in your character aiming at
someone else entirely. However, it is possible to have your marksmen
target something behind the faction leader you want to hit. This way
your marksmen have a chance of 'accidently' hitting the faction leaders
in front of the target. On occasion (Sometimes after stealing something
from them, assassination attempt etc...) you will be able to target
Diplomatic targets with a Crossbow.

Crossbows can be crafted through the [](Crossbow_Smith.md) stat.

See [Turrets](Turrets.md "wikilink") for their immobile counterparts.

## Crossbow Stat

The Crossbow stat affects the accuracy, rate of fire, and reload speed
of a crossbow user, allowing more skilled crossbowmen to shoot faster
and with greater accuracy the more they use crossbows in combat.

Certain [Light Armour](Light_Armour.md "wikilink") pieces can be worn to
directly increase a character's Crossbow stat.

- [Assassin's Rags](Assassin's_Rags.md "wikilink") (1.10x) (Also increases
  Dexterity by 20%, making Crossbows even more effective)
- [Drifters Leather Jacket](Drifters_Leather_Jacket.md "wikilink") (1.10x)
- [Ninja Rags](Ninja_Rags.md "wikilink") (1.10x)

The [Steady Arm](Steady_Arm_(left).md "wikilink") can be worn as a [](Robot_Limbs.md), but it will only provide a bonus at
\[High\] grade or above.

## Crossbow Analysis

The damage, accuracy, range, projectile velocity, reload time are all
affected by the quality of the weapon. A low-quality weapon will never
reach the best values while the highest quality bows have minimum values
much higher than the worst quality versions. Unlike other weapons
Crossbows use the same quality as Armour; ranging from Prototype to
Masterwork. Contrary to what is listed on a Crossbow's description they
all have a Bloodloss value of 2.0x. (As in if a shot would do 100 damage
against a Greenlander then they will instantly lose 40 blood)

About a character using a crossbow

Two skills and two attributes contribute to crossbow usage:

- The [Crossbows skill](Statistics.md "wikilink") itself is a value of 0 to
  100[^1]ZeroTorrent (January 3, 2022) [Crossbow
  Comparison/Analysis](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenshi/comments/rux64t/crossbow_comparisonanalysis/)
  (Reddit). Retrieved November 29, 2022.
  </ref>

  , multiplied by any equipment Crossbows effect ratios (such as from
  Ninja Rags). The effects are multiplicative; that is, 1.1x Crossbows
  effect from Ninja Rags and 1.25x Crossbows effect from a Steady Arm is
  1.375x total (1.1\*1.25, or a 37.5% bonus) rather than a 1.35x total
  (1.1+1.25, or a 35% bonus). Crossbows effect multipliers also apply to
  the Precision Shooting skill. This skill applies to accuracy deviation
  and reload time.
- [Precision Shooting](Precision_Shooting.md "wikilink") skill is used to
  calculate the accuracy of a shot, as well as the friendly fire
  avoidance. Friendly fire avoidance increases by 1.5% per level until
  capped at 100% at 66.66...% Precision Shooting.
- [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink") is used alongside the Crossbows
  skill to determine reload time.[^2]
- [Perception](Perception.md "wikilink") is used alongside the Crossbows
  skill to determine accuracy deviation. The in-game tooltip also
  suggests it affects range and shooting moving targets.[^3]

Several or all of these stats then affect heavily or slightly the
performance while using a crossbow such as:

- **Accuracy deviation** is a range of degrees by which a shot can be
  off-center, it's determined by crossbow type and quality. The
  deviation is reduced by a percentage equal to the sum of a character's
  Perception and Crossbows skill, to theoretically no deviation at 200
  total. Higher Crossbows skill can substitute for Perception and vice
  versa.[^4]
- **Reload time**, as told above, minimum and maximum values are also
  set by crossbow type and quality, but these are not randomized during
  play. Actual reload time is determined by a ratio of the sum your
  Crossbows skill and Dexterity compared to the maximum of 200 total.
  Unlike with accuracy deviation, for the purpose of reload time, this
  maxes out at 100 for each stat. Going over 100 for either stat via
  prosthetics or equipment bonuses confers no extra benefit (for
  example, having 120 Crossbows skill and 50 Dexterity only counts as
  150 total). *Lowering reload time is the only way to increase DPS,
  which means the Crossbows skill and Dexterity are the only factors
  that contribute to DPS gains for a given type and quality of
  crossbow.*[^5]
- **Range** is the distance in Kenshi units (0.1 meters) that a crossbow
  can be fired and is affected by type and quality, modified by
  Perception[^6]. The range is increased as well by firing from a higher
  elevation.

<!-- -->

- Required skill appears to be meaningless or not a reliable stat for
  using a crossbow at their best DPS/without huge repercussions during
  fighting. FCS states that this stat is the "skill level required to
  get 100% accuracy (0 deviation)" with a given crossbow, but in
  testing, this doesn't appear to be the case. 200 total Perception +
  Crossbows appeared to be the final breakpoint (rounded to the nearest
  degree in-game) for every crossbow. Your actual character skill while
  using a crossbow can be calculated like below:

`Character Skill (with Crossbow) = `[`Crossbow`](Statistics.md "wikilink")` skill + `[`Perception`](Perception.md "wikilink")` skill`

The real required skill and breakpoints/ mastered level for the main
masterwork crossbows in the game can be summarized as follows:

- 0-73: [Oldworld Bow MkI](Oldworld_Bow_MkI.md "wikilink") (best DPS
  Crossbow for a starter crossbow character)
- 74-155: [Eagle's Cross](Eagle's_Cross.md "wikilink") (best DPS Crossbow
  for a crossbow character in "middle career")
- 156-200: [Oldworld Bow MkII](Oldworld_Bow_MkII.md "wikilink") (best DPS
  Crossbow of the game/master level)
  - Important to add that vs armoured targets an Eagle's Cross will
    perform better than any other Crossbow.

While the other Crossbows may perform worse overall than the other
Oldworld Bow MKII they can still be used as support weapons. When used
en masse Crossbows such as the [Ranger](Ranger.md "wikilink") or [](Tooth_Pick.md) (Ranger more so as Toothpick has horrid
range) are fantastic at stun-locking small groups of enemies. They are
also excellent crossbow for levelling your characters Crossbow skill
without too much risk of lethal friendly fire. As reloading grants you a
small amount of Dexterity, the faster your fire the faster you will
level up.

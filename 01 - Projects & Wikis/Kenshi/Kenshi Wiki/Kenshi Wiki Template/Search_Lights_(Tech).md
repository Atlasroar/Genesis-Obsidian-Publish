**Search Lights** is [Electrics Tech](Electrics_Tech.md "wikilink") which
unlocks the ability to construct [Searchlights](Searchlight.md "wikilink")
on the sides of walls and gates.

Searchlights provide light to larger areas than [](Torch_Post.md) and [](Electrical_Torch_Post.md). They can almost cover an
entire farm, which can greatly increase farm yields by decreasing the
'working in darkness' stat drain.

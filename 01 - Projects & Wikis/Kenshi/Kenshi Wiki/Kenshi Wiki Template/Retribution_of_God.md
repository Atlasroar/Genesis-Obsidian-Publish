**Retribution of God** is an event that can occur if the player's
outpost is within 7,000 meters of a [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) owned location, and [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md), or both him and [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), are killed or
captured. (Note: There is supposed to be a variant for just Seta killed
as well, but due to a bug it cannot trigger. when seta is captured the
squad will directly spawn at seta's location) It has up to a 50% chance
of triggering if within 4,000 meters of a [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) location, and scales down with
distance until it reach 0% chance at 7,000 meters.

This event cannot trigger if [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md), and the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) are all killed or captured.

Once triggered, [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") will
launch an assault on the player's base. It will consist of two or three
squads. The first consisting of 5 [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink") and 3
[Inquisitors](Inquisitor.md "wikilink") led by [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), while the second and potential
third consist of 10-12 [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), 1-2 [](High_Paladin.md), and 4-9 [](Holy_Servant.md) led by an
[Inquisitor](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"). In the event that [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) is not available to lead the
assault, the first squad will not spawn, and the third squad that
normally only has a chance to spawn will be guaranteed to accompany the
assault.

After arriving at the outpost, the War Leader will issue the arrest of
the character or characters responsible for the attack on a High
Inquisitor, and then order his men to attack the outpost and the player
characters inside it. If the raid is victorious, they will occupy the
player's base, patrolling around it, using the furniture, freeing
captives, and imprisoning your characters. If the raid is defeated, it
will trigger a [Wrath of God](Wrath_of_God.md "wikilink") event in 36-80
hours.

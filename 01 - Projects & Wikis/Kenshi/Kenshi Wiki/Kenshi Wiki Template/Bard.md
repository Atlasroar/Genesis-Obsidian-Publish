## Songs

If the player recruits Bard to their squad, Bard will periodically sing
various songs at random. Below are some of the song lyrics Bard has been
known to sing. ***\*Note that none of the songs Bard sings are given
titles in the game, so any titles we have listed below are nicknames for
the songs.***

### The Ballad of Harmothoe\*

> *"Harmothoe, Harmothoe, she lived a life of anguish!
> For chained in Rebirth she was condemned to languish...
> 'Til one day she'd been ravished by the high paladin most vile!
> And she swore her dark vengeance with a murderous smile...
> She stashed a long nail, forged to a blade...
> And one by one the guards were slayed.
> Now the high paladin lies dead, a nail in the eyeball...
> With it the name Harmothoe, in blood on the high wall!"*

#### Audience reception

> "...Don't go giving me ideas about your eyeballs, bard... "
> "\*Clap clap\*"
> "Encore, encore! More eyeball stabbing!"

### Tinfist the Righteous\*

> *"Oh! There once was a noble, handsome and bearded...
> Who took a liking to shooting a spear did!
> The noble laughed with glee as his slaves did plee...
> And he killed a hundred while laughter thundered!
> But along came Tinfist and the laughs rang quiet...
> The noble pissed his pants and the slaves had a riot!
> Just a swift blow with the fist and he fell to the floor...
> And the bearded noble was handsome no more!*

#### Audience reception

that's for sure..."

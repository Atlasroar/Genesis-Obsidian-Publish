This is a Watchtower that is controlled by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) situated in [](Okran's_Valley.md). A few guards can be seen outside on
shifts, on the inside, a good amount will be sleeping until you walk in.
Inside you can find food, some Armor, weapons and of course Beds to rest
and heal the wounded.

Given the location that it's built in, it likely serves as a place for
scouting and fending off enemy military forces from [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) to prevent them from advancing through
[Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink"). Occasionally it may also serve to
dissuade the [Flotsam Ninjas](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") patrols that
attempt to break through the border at [](Northern_Coast.md), and/or the
[Cannibal](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") hordes that keep infiltrating the area
of [Okran's Valley](Okran's_Valley.md "wikilink").

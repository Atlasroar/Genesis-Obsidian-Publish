There are a few, limited, cases where pages may be
**[deleted](Help:Deletion "wikilink") speedily**. Non-admins can ask for
an [admin](Help:User_access_levels "wikilink") to delete such a page
simply by adding a [{{speedydelete}}](Template:Speedydelete "wikilink")
tag.

A list of pages to be deleted can be found at [:Category:Candidates for
speedy deletion](:Category:Candidates_for_speedy_deletion "wikilink").

When deleting, check the [page history](Help:Page_history "wikilink")
first to see if you can [revert](Help:Reverting "wikilink") to an older
version instead of deleting the entire page.

You can consider turning problematic pages into relevant redirects as an
alternative to deletion.

Ideally, when an admin deletes a test page or other page with no useful
content, it is a good idea to put a note on the author's talk page
explaining things, and preserving the deleted content, pointing them to
the [sandbox](Project:Sandbox "wikilink") in cases of tests.

## Examples of candidates for speedy deletion

1.  No meaningful content or history (*e.g.* random characters).
2.  Test pages (*e.g.*, "Can I really create a page here?").
3.  Pure [vandalism](Help:Vandalism "wikilink") (see also [dealing with
    vandalism](Wikipedia:Wikipedia:Dealing_with_vandalism "wikilink")).
4.  Very short pages with little or no context (*e.g.*, "He is a funny
    man that has created Factory and the Hacienda. And, by the way, his
    wife is great.")
5.  Reposted content that was already deleted according to policy.
6.  Pages that have been moved to another Wikia because they were
    uploaded in the wrong place.
7.  Temporarily deleting a page in order to [move a
    page](Help:Moving_pages "wikilink").
8.  Broken redirects or ones caused by typos during a page move.
9.  Duplicate images.
10. Talk pages of already deleted articles.
11. User talk pages of non-logged in users where the message is no
    longer relevant. (This is to avoid confusing new users who happen to
    edit with that same IP address.)
12. Empty categories.
13. User and talk pages on request of the user, where there is no
    significant abuse, and no administrative need to retain the page.

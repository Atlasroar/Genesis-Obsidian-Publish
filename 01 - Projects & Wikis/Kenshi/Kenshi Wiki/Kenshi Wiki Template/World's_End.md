**World's End** is a major town found on a mountain top in the [](Arm_of_Okran.md). It is currently the home base of the
[Tech Hunters](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink") faction. A
**[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") to World's End** can help find this location.
The [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") pacifier can be found here.

## Lore

World's End, as the home base of the Tech Hunters, offers one of the
largest stores of machine and science items within Holy Nation
territory. Finch, the head of the University of Machinist, details that
despite being within Holy Nation territory, and the prevalence of Okran
statues within the town, the town is totally independent from the Holy
Nation. He argues that the statues were sufficient enough to trick the
gullible Holy Nation authorities into leaving the town alone. Because of
this, one can find a large number of Skeletons within its walls, whereas
in any part of the Holy Nation, just about all Skeletons are killed
on-sight.

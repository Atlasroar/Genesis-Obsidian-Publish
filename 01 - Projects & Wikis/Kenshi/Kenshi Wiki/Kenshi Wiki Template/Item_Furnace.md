Players can construct this [building](Buildings_List.md "wikilink"). After
researching [Weapon Melting](Weapon_Melting.md "wikilink") it will appear
in the Crafting category in the Build Mode menu. All items can be burned
but only some types produce [Raw Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink"), mainly
melee weapons. The stack of produced iron can go as high as 2,000. This
building can only be constructed on the ground so it is impossible to
build one in a bought house.

An ulterior use of the Item Furnace is laundering stolen goods. Any
items put in and then removed will lose their [](Thievery.md) and stack properly.

**Chain Armour Crafting** is [Smithing Tech](Smithing_Tech.md "wikilink")
which unlocks the ability to create [](Chainmail_Sheet.md) and construct a [](Chain_Armour_Crafting_Bench.md). All
[Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") made from chainmail requires additional
[Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink") to craft.

Players should ensure that their outpost has a good source of [](Steel_Bars.md) and [Fabrics](Fabrics.md "wikilink"), both of
which are required for creating Chain Armour. Making Chainmail Sheets is
a good way to train a character's [](Armour_Smith.md) stat.

**Purple Sands** is a large desert north of [](The_Shrieking_Forest.md) and south of [](The_Iron_Trail.md). The region is immediately
recognizable for the purple hue of its desert sand and satellite like
structures partially buried everywhere in the desert.

The region itself is barren, but occasionally
[Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink"), [](Shrieking_Bandits.md) and [](Beak_Thing.md) wander into the area from other regions.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") or [](Minor_Outposts.md) in Purple Sands. This zone does not
spawn [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps.

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

- [Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink")
- [Shrieking Bandits](Shrieking_Bandits.md "wikilink")
- [Beak Thing](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink")
- [Garru](Garru.md "wikilink")

*These squads can potentially spawn in this zone if certain World
States have been reached.*

## Environment

Sandstorms constantly plague the region allowing it to have high wind
speed. Due to absence of water, the area is considered an area of
extreme climate and one of the most inhospitable regions in the game.
Also, prospecting reveals no raw resources within the region further
reinforcing that the region cannot be colonized. Occasionally individual
[beak things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") may be found lost in the desert.

### Weather

*This zone has the 'purple desert' season. Seasons may cause harmful
[Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") or be purely aesthetic.*

**Slaver Heavy Guards** are members of the [](Traders_Guild.md). They are a melee-only variant of the
[Slaver Guard](Slaver_Guard.md "wikilink"), and despite being called a
'heavy', wear the same armour of their non-heavy counterparts.

They are frequently found patrolling slave camps and guarding the gates,
and occasionally accompany Slaver Caravans.

Occasionally, they lead raids into player outposts "not on the list",
looking for fresh slaves. They will relent, however, if a base is too
large for them to easily take down.

**Town Overrides** are new locations which spawn to replace other
locations. Town Overrides are a result of a [](World_States.md) change.

Many places are able to become DEAD when all or enough inhabitants have
been killed. This is different than when a location falls into ruins due
to a Town Override.

If more than one override becomes available at the same time, the one
with the most world states on it will take priority. And if there is a
tie, the highest one in the override list will be selected.

Any buildings purchased by the player will not be destroyed/lost due to
Town Overrides.

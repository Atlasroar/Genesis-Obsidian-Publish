**Flying Bull**(also named Ida) is a huge [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink")
warrior and the leader of [Kral's Chosen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md "wikilink"). He
resides in [New Kralia](New_Kralia.md "wikilink"), carrying around a unique
[Fragment Axe](Fragment_Axe.md "wikilink") named [](Bull_Horn_Axe.md) gifted by [](King_Shager's_Reign.md).

Soon after Shager's overthrow, Ida, better known as Flying Bull, a
devout follower of [King Shager](King_Shager's_Reign.md "wikilink"),
rebelled against [The Stone Golem's](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink")
new rule, instead cementing himself as an extremist and ultranationalist
following [Shager's](King_Shager's_Reign.md "wikilink") doctrine of
[Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") supremacy, claiming the [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) has proven herself a coward
bowing to the [Flatskins](Flatskins.md "wikilink") by not continuing to
fight against the [Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") until the
end. He recruits many of [Shagar's](Shager's_Overthrow.md "wikilink")
supporters, declares himself [](Flying_Bull.md), and departs from
[Admag](Admag.md "wikilink"), establishing the rebel outpost of [](New_Kralia.md) and the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md).

His actual bounty is 30,000 Cats with the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

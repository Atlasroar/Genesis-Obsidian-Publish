**Monk Pants** are clothing that are wearable as pants. They are also
widely available at Clothing Traders throughout the game. They neither
improve or decrease protection or stats for the character wearing them.

Monk Pants are most notably worn by [Finch](Finch.md "wikilink") and
[Iyo](Iyo.md "wikilink") as well as [Holy Priest](Holy_Priest.md "wikilink"),
[Holy Citizen](Holy_Citizen.md "wikilink"), and [](Holy_Farmer_Wife.md) characters. When worn by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) characters they are part of a set
with the [Monk Robe](Monk_Robe.md "wikilink") (though they often substitute
these pants with [Stout Hessian](Stout_Hessian.md "wikilink")).

This armour has inventory dimensions of **4x5**.

## Appearance

Monk Pants are orange in color and fit loose on the characters legs.

## Crafting

They are craft-able on a [Clothing Bench](Clothing_Bench.md "wikilink")
after purchasing blueprints from a [](Clothing_Trader.md).

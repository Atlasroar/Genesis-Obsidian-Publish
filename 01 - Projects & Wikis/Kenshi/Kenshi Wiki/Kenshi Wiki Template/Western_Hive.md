**Western Hive** is a faction of the [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink") race which
dwell in a series of [Hive Villages](Hive_Village.md "wikilink") and
[Distant Hive Villages](Distant_Hive_Village.md "wikilink").

Most Hive [Playable Characters](Playable_Characters.md "wikilink") in the
game originate from the Western Hive (instead of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md)), and will often mention their
reluctance to return to their home when they enter
[Vain](Vain.md "wikilink").

## Relations

### Player Relations

*The reasons for this faction to have a non-zero relation towards you.*

- While the [Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink") in the [](Hive_Village.md) will refuse to work with "hiveless"
  [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink") characters, the traders from the **Western
  Hive** do not seem to care about this when they visit the player's
  outpost or trade in the wilderness. Sometimes the hive caravans will
  sell the player a [](Lantern_of_Radiance.md), at a significantly inflated
  price compared to buying them at a Hive Village.

## Locations

## Trivia

- Some Hive Traders won't trade with squads that have Hive characters in
  the squad. These NPCs often call the squad members as "Lost Ones" or
  "Hiveless", and might attack the player if they don't leave the shop.

<!-- -->

- Hive Traders have [diplomatic status.](Diplomatic_Status.md "wikilink")
- It is quite likely that several commodities that can be bought in Hive
  Villages are stolen, noted by how Hive Traders ironically expose
  themselves to further suspicions by claiming that all goods are
  "authentic and not stolen".
- [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") issues trade embargo on
  **Western Hive**.
- **Western Hive** and [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink") are
  competitive enemies in economy.
- [Southern Hive](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink") are hostile towards Western
  Hive, but not vice-versa.
- Western Hive have a similar (-50) Trustworthy value, similar to most
  other bandit factions.

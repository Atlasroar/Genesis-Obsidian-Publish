The **Tower of Ninjas** is the home of the [](Black_Dragon_Ninjas.md). It is located in the northeast
region of the [Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink"). This location can
be discovered by reading a **Tech Hunters [Map](Maps.md "wikilink")**.

Upon entering the tower, the Black Dragon Ninja faction becomes hostile
and attacks; they will, however, also attack mobs like [](Dust_Bandits.md), so you can lead a group in to help.
The layout of the tower is very similar to that of a [](Shinobi_Thieves.md) tower, with [](Black_Dragon_Genin.md) manning four crossbow turrets on
the roof.

The location is home to [Dimak](Dimak.md "wikilink") and
[Buzan](Buzan.md "wikilink"), the leaders of the faction, both of whom are
wanted by [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") with a 20,000
cat price on each. Dimak wields a [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") quality
[Ninja Blade](Ninja_Blade.md "wikilink").

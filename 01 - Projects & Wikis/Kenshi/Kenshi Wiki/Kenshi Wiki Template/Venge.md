**Venge** consists of heated valleys and mountains. The most distinctive
feature of Venge are the laser beams that damage anyone who is not
wearing 100% [Burn resistance](Weather_Effects.md#Burning "wikilink") armor
(except the [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink")) with cut damage.

Player characters may also comment that Venge is "where the gutters come
to hunt for spiders." Although [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") and
[Blood Spiders](Blood_Spider.md "wikilink") as well as [](Iron_Spider.md) can spawn in this area, the primary
dangers are large squads of [Weak Thralls](Weak_Thrall.md "wikilink").

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") in Venge. This zone
does not spawn [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps.

### Minor Outposts

*These locations are typically small towns, villages, or faction bases.*

- [Old Control Tower](Old_Control_Tower.md "wikilink")
- [Tower of Abuse](Tower_of_Abuse.md "wikilink")

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Ruined Control Tower](Ruined_Control_Tower.md "wikilink")
- [Waystation Ruins](Waystation_Ruins.md "wikilink")

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

- [Thrall Masters](Thrall_Masters.md "wikilink")
- [Beak Thing](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink")
- [Blood Spider](Blood_Spider.md "wikilink")
- [Iron Spider](Iron_Spider.md "wikilink")

## Environment

Though this area has some fertile land, the majority of the region sits
at 0% fertility.

## Tips

- If you do not want to risk the lasers, it is best to venture this zone
  at night since the lasers only come on during the day. The best time
  to head into Venge would be 23:00, and the best time to find cover
  would be 05:00.
- When inside a building a character will not take damage from the
  beams. This includes being on the top floor. Care should be taken,
  though, when loading a save indoors, as if a beam happens to spawn on
  top of a character, they **will take damage** for a short time until
  the game registers that the unit is indoors.

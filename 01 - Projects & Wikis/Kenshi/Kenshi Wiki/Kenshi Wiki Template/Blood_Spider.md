Primarily found in [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"), Blood Spiders hunt
down and suck the nutrition out of live prey.

They attack in groups and are more dangerous than, say, an average group
of [dust bandits](Dust_Bandits.md "wikilink"). Blood Spiders are highly
resistant to bleeding damage and recover consciousness quickly. They
will try to eat an unconscious or dying character by draining their
hunger.

There is also a rarer, and stronger, variant known as the [](Elder_Blood_Spider.md).

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which Blood
Spiders have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

## Spawns

### Regions

Standard Blood Spider swarms spawn in [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"),
the [South Wetlands](South_Wetlands.md "wikilink"), and the [](Burning_Forest.md). In The Swamp, there is a 20/75
chance of spawning a swarm of Blood Spiders, assuming that nothing has
happened to nearby faction leaders. In the South Wetlands, there is a
1/9 chance of spawning a swarm of Blood Spiders, assuming that nothing
has happened to the boss of the Red Sabres.

The regions [Shem](Shem.md "wikilink") and [Venge](Venge.md "wikilink") may
also spawn Blood Spiders in small groups. The chances of spawning these
groups in Shem is 1/26 and in Venge is 2/63.

### Spawn Groups

Standard Blood Spider swarms can contain from 1 to 10 spiders. These
spiders will be roughly adult age.

Small groups of Blood Spiders can contain from 1 to 3 spiders.

### Other Locations

Besides spawns, Blood Spiders can also be found is set locations around
the map.

Blood Spiders can also spawn in [Lost Library](Lost_Library.md "wikilink")
outposts. These swarms will be nested and will not roam the rest of the
region. These swarms can contain from 6 to 15 spiders. These spiders
will almost be fully grown.

There are two [Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink") that have nested
Blood Spiders as well. The [Swamped Lab](Swamped_Lab.md "wikilink") can
contain anywhere from 5 to 25 Blood Spiders. The Infested Lab can have
from 5 to 20 spiders.

The [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") can have from 6 to 10 pet Blood
Spiders.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If [Big Grim](Big_Grim.md "wikilink"), [](Big_Darkbrow.md) and [Big Gray](Big_Gray.md "wikilink")
are all dead, [Rot](Rot.md "wikilink") will be destroyed and invaded by
Blood Spiders.

**Tiny Settlement** is a small deserted outpost located on a mountain in
the most eastern area of [Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink"). It
belongs to [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"), but there are
no residents nor roaming guards. There are three ruined buildings, two
of which contain [building materials](Building_Materials.md "wikilink"),
[iron plates](Iron_Plate.md "wikilink"), [fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink")Â and some
less useful items. The other building contains low quality swords. It
can be found by exploration or by reading the **[Map](Maps.md "wikilink")
of the Border Zone.**

It is a good place to scavenge for players who want to build an outpost
nearby.

Note: Despite being a ruined town, the Holy Nation [](Base_Assault.md) can spawn from this location.

Given the location that this outpost is located in, it is likely to have
been abandoned or destroyed in the midst of the war between **The Holy
Nation** and [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink").

There's a similar nearby location where the same selection of loot can
be found - the [Holy Mine Ruins](Holy_Mine_Ruin.md "wikilink") in
[Skinner's Roam](Skinner's_Roam.md "wikilink"). Yet another location
formerly controlled by the Holy Nation is also found in close
proximity - [Ruined Holy Outpost](Ruined_Holy_Outpost.md "wikilink").

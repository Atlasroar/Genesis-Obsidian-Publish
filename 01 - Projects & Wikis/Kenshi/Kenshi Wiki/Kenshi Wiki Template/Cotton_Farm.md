A Cotton Farm produces [Cotton](Cotton.md "wikilink"), which can be used to
make [fabric](Fabrics.md "wikilink"). It can be farmed most efficiently in
areas with the Green [Environment](Environment.md "wikilink").

Contrary to the description, cotton can also be grown inside an Arid or
Swamp environment, as long as there is more than 0% of Green environment
there as well.

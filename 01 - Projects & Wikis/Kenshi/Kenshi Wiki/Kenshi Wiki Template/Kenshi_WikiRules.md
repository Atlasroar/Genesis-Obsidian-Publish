The Kenshi Wiki, like other FANDOM wikis, is reliant on volunteer
collaboration. We don't intend to set limits on participation with
overbearing regulations. However, these simple rules are still necessary
guidelines for Kenshi Wiki behavior. Breaking of these rules will result
in bans.

### Language

No racist, sexist, homophobic, transphobic, or ableist language use.
Similarly, avoid using slurs or otherwise derogatory remarks with intent
to offend or harm. To ensure the wiki is safe for all ages, don't post
or link to gore, porn, or sexually graphic material.

### Civility

Keep it civil, and generally be decent to other people. Disagreeing with
one another on some topics is natural. Disagreements don't need to and
shouldn't result in hostility or conflict from either side.

### Controversial Topics

Kenshi is inspired by many different real world cultures. However,
discussion of these influences typically leads to fighting quickly.
Therefore, no discussing real word religion, politics, or other
controversial topics.

### Spam

No spamming or advertising.

### Vandalism

No vandalizing pages with nonsense or irrelevant information.

### Support Lo-Fi

The discussion or facilitation of piracy will not be tolerated.

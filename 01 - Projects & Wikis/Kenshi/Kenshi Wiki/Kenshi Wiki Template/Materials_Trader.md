**Materials Trader** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger
if the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 11,000 meters of
a [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") owned location. It cannot
trigger if the player is an enemy of the [](Western_Hive.md), or if [The Queen](The_Queen.md "wikilink")
has been killed or captured. Not to be confused with the [](Farm_Trader.md) event, the other caravan from the
[Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink").

When the conditions have been fulfilled, the event has a 10% chance each
day to trigger if the player's base is within 6,000 meters, this chance
scales down with distance until it reaches 0% chance at 11,000 meters.

Once triggered, the [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") will send a
caravan to the player's base, consisting of 8-10 [](Caravan_Drone.md) and 2-3 [](Pack_Beast.md), led by a [](Hive_Caravan_Boss.md).

arrives, the leader will shout out asking the player to come trade. If
the player does so, they will be met with a selection from the items
below.

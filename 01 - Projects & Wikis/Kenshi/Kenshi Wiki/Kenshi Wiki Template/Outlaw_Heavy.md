**Outlaw Heavies** are members of the [](Rebel_Farmers.md) faction. These are the closest the
rebel farmers have to heavy infantry, forming the core of heavy squads
roaming [Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink"), [](Grey_Desert.md), [Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"), and
[Sinkuun](Sinkuun.md "wikilink"). They can be found in groups of 3-7,
sometimes being tagged along by 1-3 [](Outlaw_Swordsman.md), but always being led by an
[Outlaw Swordsman Captain](Outlaw_Swordsman_Captain.md "wikilink").

With [Lord Inaba](Lord_Inaba.md "wikilink") dead, an extra heavy squad will
spawn (with a higher maximum of 11 Heavies) in Bast, Heng, and [](Stormgap_Coast.md).

Heavies can also be found in groups of 5-6 in Barracks in [](Fort_Simion.md), as well 4-6 serving as bodyguards for
[Boss Simion](Boss_Simion.md "wikilink") himself.

They will also populate the Barracks in peasant-controlled [](Port_North.md), [Port South](Port_South.md "wikilink"), and
[Slave Farm South](Slave_Farm_South.md "wikilink").

A heavy squad will also help repel attacks by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) on the player base should the player
be an ally of the Rebel Farmers.

All these squads stop spawning when [](Emperor_Tengu.md) is killed, having presumably either
laying down the sword, or joining the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md).Â 

They have a 10% chance to have a bounty ranging from 2500 to 3500 Cats.

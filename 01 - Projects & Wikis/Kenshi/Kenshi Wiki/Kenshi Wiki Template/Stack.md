**Stack** is a large town on the edge of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) territory. It has a decent variety
of shops, and its proximity to the [](Western_Hive.md) and [the Hub](The_Hub.md "wikilink") make it
a good location for aspiring traders and thieves alike.

The surrounding areas often have [](Starving_Bandits.md), [Bonedogs](Bonedog.md "wikilink"),
and [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandits.md "wikilink"), all of which are relatively
weak enemies, making this a decent training area for newer characters.

The [Game Start](Game_Starts.md "wikilink") "Holy Nation Citizen" can begin
at this location, the other possible choice is in [](Bad_Teeth.md). If you are not starting out in this town
you can place it on your map after travelling here or by reading the
**Glorious Holy [Map](Maps.md "wikilink")**.

This is the place of residence of [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md). Mother of
[Knife](Knife.md "wikilink"), a [](Unique_Recruits.md) parent, supposedly lives here.
[Bard](Bard.md "wikilink") and [Griffin](Griffin.md "wikilink") could spawn
here to be recruited in a bar.

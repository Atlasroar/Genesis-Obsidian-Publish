**Mud Town** is a [Swampers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Swampers.md "wikilink") village located north
of [Shark](Shark.md "wikilink") within [the Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink").
It can be discovered by trudging through the swamp or by acquiring and
reading the **[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the Swamps**.
[Twinblades](Twinblades.md "wikilink") leader, [](Big_Fang.md), resides within the village. The local
[Bar](Bar.md "wikilink") is run by the
[Blackshifters](Blackshifters.md "wikilink").

Mud Town has the potential to spawn the most unique recruits than any
other swamp village, or even Shark. [](Doctor_Chung.md), [Green](Green.md "wikilink") and [](Stubs_Momuso.md) can be recruited here if they are not
in Shark. [Silvershade](Silvershade.md "wikilink") has the highest chance
to spawn here. [Hamut](Hamut.md "wikilink") might be found here as well.

The [Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") pacifier can be found here.

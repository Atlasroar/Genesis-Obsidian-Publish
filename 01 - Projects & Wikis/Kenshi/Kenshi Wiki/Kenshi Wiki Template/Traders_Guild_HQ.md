The [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink") HQ is the home of
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") and [Yamdu](Yamdu.md "wikilink") in [](Trader's_Edge.md). It should not be confused with another
building in the same location, named [Bank](Bank.md "wikilink"). The Bank
is a vault or storehouse location, while the Traders Guild HQ is a
[Faction HQ](Faction_HQ.md "wikilink").

If the player kills or imprisones Tengu and Longen while Tinfist is
alive and free, the HQ will be turned into what looks like [](Tengu's_Vault.md) 2.0 and named "Prison".

If the player kills or imprisons Tengu, Longen and Tinfist, the Ancient
Lab will be put for sale at 320 000 cats. It becomes the most expensive
investment in the game, as Traderâ€™s Edge turns to the Empire Peasants
override.

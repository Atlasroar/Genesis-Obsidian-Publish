**Band of Bones** are the generic members of the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md) faction. They can be found roaming the
regions of [Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink"), [](High_Bonefields.md), [Shem](Shem.md "wikilink"),
[Shun](Shun.md "wikilink"), [Spider Plains](Spider_Plains.md "wikilink"), [](The_Hook.md), and [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink") in
groups of 4 to 8. If [Tora the Fearless](Tora_the_Fearless.md "wikilink")
is not alive however, these groups are reduced to 2 to 4 members.

They live in the [Exile Camp](Exile_Camp.md "wikilink") but if [](Big_Gray.md) and [Big Grim](Big_Grim.md "wikilink") are not
alive while Tora is, they take over [](Grayflayer_Village.md) and may make that their new
headquarters.

They will raid the player outpost if it is in range with a sizeable
force.

## Interactions

If a **Band of Bones** warrior is found in a non-shek biome, they may
challenge the player to a battle, which the player can decline.
Accepting or insulting them will cause a normal fight.

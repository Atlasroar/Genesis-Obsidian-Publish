A **Megacrab Ganglion**is a unique item for which the only use is to
sell. 5 can be found on the bodies of [Megacrab](Megacrab.md "wikilink"),
[Barnabus](Barnabus.md "wikilink"), [Mr Gigantus](Mr_Gigantus.md "wikilink"),
and [The Crabinator](The_Crabinator.md "wikilink")

The Megacrab is only found in the [Howler Maze](Howler_Maze.md "wikilink")
and it may not be worth the effort to go there for only this item,
especially since the only notable locations in that area are the [](Lost_Library.md).

If players are after money, it may be easier to simply raid [](Nest_of_Beak_Things.md) for [](Beak_Thing_Egg.md), since those are not unique and sell
fairly well. [ru:Ганглий Мегакраба](ru:Ганглий_Мегакраба "wikilink")

**Flat Shelters** are [Camping](Camping.md "wikilink")
[buildings](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") which the player can construct
anywhere after learning the blueprint. They require very few materials
in order to construct and do not result in the creation of a [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md). Camps can be used as a
quick shelter from acid rain. If you so wish, this tent can fit inside
most [buildings](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") and also be constructed on
top of them.

The blueprint can be purchased from any of these locations:

- [Adventurer Bar](Adventurer_Bar.md "wikilink")
- [Flats Lagoon Bar](Flats_Lagoon_Bar.md "wikilink")
- [Shark Travel Shop](Shark_Travel_Shop.md "wikilink")
- [Tech Hunter Shop](Tech_Hunter_Shop.md "wikilink")
- [Travel and Repairs Shop](Travel_and_Repairs_Shop.md "wikilink")
- [Travel Gear](Travel_Gear.md "wikilink")

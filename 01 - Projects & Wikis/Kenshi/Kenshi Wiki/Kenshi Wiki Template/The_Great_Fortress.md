An outpost owned by the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink"). Its
location can be revealed by reading the **[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the
Shek Kingdom**.

Even though it has the word 'great' in its name, it certainly doesn't
look that way with its many destroyed buildings. The only operational
buildings here are one Police Station and one Faction HQ.

Since it's located near [New Kralia](New_Kralia.md "wikilink") it is a
great spot to turn in [Flying Bull](Flying_Bull.md "wikilink"), the leader
of [Kral's Chosen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md "wikilink"), to the police.

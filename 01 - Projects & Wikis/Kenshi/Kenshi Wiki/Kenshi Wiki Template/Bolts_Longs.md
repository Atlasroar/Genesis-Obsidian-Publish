**Bolts \[Longs\]** are ammunition used with
[Crossbows](Crossbow_(Class).md "wikilink").

After researching [Crossbow Bolts](Crossbow_Bolts_(Tech).md "wikilink") and
learning the [Blueprint](Blueprints.md "wikilink") (that can be bought in
[World's End](World's_End.md "wikilink")), these bolts can be made on an
[Arrow Making Bench](Arrow_Making_Bench.md "wikilink") for 0.5 steel bars
per Bolts \[Longs\]. They can later be stored in
aÂ [Boltbox](Boltbox.md "wikilink").

These bolts are the rarest bolts in Kenshi, as most of the ranger shops
on the map do not sell them. Available places to buy large quantities of
these bolts are the ranger shops in [](World's_End.md) and [Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"). They can
also be found as rare loot in several ruins.

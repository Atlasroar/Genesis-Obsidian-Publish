**Harmothoe** is a unique member of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Free_Traders.md). She can be found leading a caravan,
which can trade goods with the player. She can be found in either
[Heng](Heng.md "wikilink") or [Trader's Edge](Trader's_Edge.md "wikilink").

Her caravan includes 2 [Pack Beasts](Pack_Beast.md "wikilink") and 8 to 10
[Caravan Guards](Caravan_Guard.md "wikilink").

She is warmly receptive to female characters, and more curt and rude to
males. She outright refuses to deal with
[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") and may trigger combat with any
skeletons who speak to her.

[Bard](Bard.md "wikilink") sings a song about her, which alleges she was
originally a slave in [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") that escaped by
killing the guards, including a [](High_Paladin.md) that raped her.

If the player is allied with the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), she will be reluctant to trade with
you.

If she is killed, a [](Caravan_Trader_Boss.md) (Free Traders) will replace her
position.

## Ballad of Harmothoe

"*Harmothoe, Harmothoe, she lived a live of anguish!*

*For chained in Rebirth she was condemned to languish,*

*'Til one day she'd been ravished by the high paladin most vile!*

*And she swore her dark vengeance with a murderous smile...*

*She stashed a long nail, forged to a blade...*

*And one by one the guards were slayed...*

*Now the high paladin lies dead, a nail in the eyeball...*

*With it the name Harmothoe, in blood on the high wall!"*

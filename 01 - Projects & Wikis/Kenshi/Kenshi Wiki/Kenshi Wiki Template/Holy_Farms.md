Holy Farms are a series of similar [](Minor_Outposts.md) of [Greenlanders](Human.md "wikilink")
located in territory owned by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and are the presumed source of food
and farm based [trade goods](Trade_Goods.md "wikilink") for the faction.
Their location can be learned by reading the **Glorious Holy
[Map](Maps.md "wikilink").**

There are in total 6 Holy Farms, 4 of them are located in [](Okran's_Pride.md) while the other 2 are located in
[Okran's Valley](Okran's_Valley.md "wikilink"). The Northernmost is the
only one growing Cactus whilst the others grow Greenfruit, Cotton and
Wheat.

## Behavior

While [Holy Farmers](Holy_Farmer.md "wikilink"), [](Holy_Farmer_Wife.md) and domesticated animals make up the
vast majority of the population, the only NPC with dialogue options is
the [Holy Farm Leader](Holy_Farm_Leader.md "wikilink") who will trade farm
based [trade goods](Trade_Goods.md "wikilink") and domesticated animals
with the player.

Every farm has at least one field of crops and is typically used for
growing either [Cotton](Cotton.md "wikilink"),
[Greenfruit](Greenfruit.md "wikilink") or [wheat](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink")
(the northernmost farm has [Cactus](Cactus.md "wikilink")) that is tended
to by the Holy Farmers during the day.

Holy Farmer Wives do not seem to have a labor schedule, offer dialogue
options or even spawn with a weapon. They remain inside with the Holy
Farm Leader the majority of the time and flee during combat.

## Town overrides

Holy Farms will only be [overridden](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") and
captured by the [Slave Traders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink"), functionally
turning it into a slave farm, if [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md),
[Esata](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink"), and either [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) or [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) have been killed/kidnapped, as
long as [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink") and
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") are still alive and free.

## Trivia

- Even after becoming hostile to the Holy Nation, the domesticated
  animals of Holy Farms don't attack on sight or protect their allies
  even though their primary task is always "patrolling town."

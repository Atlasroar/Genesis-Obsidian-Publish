**Deadhive Overrun** is a ruin of a town which has been overtaken by
[Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink"). This location is in the [](Okran's_Gulf.md) zone, to the north near the [](Fog_Islands.md). Aside from potentially a [](Fog_Prince_Head.md), there is no major loot here.

Deadhive Overrun likely used to be a town controlled by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md).

Hive villages can be turned into something similar to this if the
faction's Hive Queen is harmed.

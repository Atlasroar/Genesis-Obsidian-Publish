**Rebirth Slaves** is a faction label for slaves from
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink"). These Slaves are forced to work the
quarry there until they die. This work supposedly helps these characters
to be reborn as 'righteous' humans thanks to their service for the god
[Okran](Okran.md "wikilink"). Rebirth Slaves are comprised of members from
every race except [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink"), which are deemed
unworthy of life in the eyes of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md).

Slaves from Rebirth are capable of being [](Slave_Recruits.md). Players can bring slaves to their
side by unlocking their shackles or cages and keeping them safe for a
time afterwards. If characters are caught escaping or attempting escape,
the Holy Nation guards will attack them and alarms may be raised.

## Rebirth slave behavior

Rebirth slave behavior can be sorted in three categories:

- Slaves unwilling to escape. They will not react to their cage or
  prisoner pole getting unlocked and when their shackles are unlocked,
  they are fearful of the potential consequences from the guards.
- Slaves willing to escape which follow the liberator. They will ask a
  player-controlled character (liberator) to unlock their shackles when
  their cage or prisoner pole lock is unlocked and will follow the
  character which unlocked both or the shackles. If the liberator
  escapes successfully, or covers enough distance before getting
  captured, there is a high chance of joining the group.
- Slaves willing to escape which don't follow the liberator. They will
  behave like the group mentioned just above here, but they will try to
  escape alone when both locks are picked succesfully.

The first category slaves can be used for lockpicking and/or
assasination training. The second and third group slaves should only be
unlocked when the player-controlled characters have a decent chance of
escaping, as some slaves are trying to escape without the player when
one or more escape attempts have failed. They might get injured more,
which may result in them losing limbs or even their death when the
guards forget to put them back into a cage after beating them up or
forgetting to heal them.

## Trivia

- Rebirth Slaves are disproportionately much more likely to be
  [Sheks](Shek.md "wikilink") than any other races.
- Shek rebirth slaves have the same faction color assigned to them as
  the shek kingdom, and will color armor that color if worn, strongly
  suggesting they are former shek warriors captured as POWs

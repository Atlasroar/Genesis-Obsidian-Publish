**Cannibal Grand Wizard** is leader of the
[Cannibals](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") faction and located in [](Cannibal_Capital.md). Despite being a leader he does
not have [Diplomatic Status](Diplomatic_Status.md "wikilink") nor [](World_States.md) associated with him.

He is wanted by [The Holy Nation](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"), [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md), and [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) for 40,000 Cats. If you bring him to
The Bastion, the Cannibal Hunters will have no unique dialogue about
him.

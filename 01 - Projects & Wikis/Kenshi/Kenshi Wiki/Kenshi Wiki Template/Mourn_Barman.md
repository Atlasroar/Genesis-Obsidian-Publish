The **Mourn Barman** is an unnamed member of the [](Trade_Ninjas.md). He resides in the
[Bar](Bar_of_Mourn.md "wikilink") in [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink").

Upon asking him about the place, he will tell the player a small story
and warn them not to enter the HQ, calling the locked gates a 'pest
control measure'.

Upon getting rid of the [pest](Great_White_Gorillo.md "wikilink") and
returning with a [trophy](Great_White_Claw.md "wikilink"), the Barman will
be impressed and will give the player free [Grog](Grog.md "wikilink") and
[Sake](Sake.md "wikilink").

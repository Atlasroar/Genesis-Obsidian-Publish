**Reaver Slaves** are slaves of the [Reavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink").
Reaver Slaves are members of the [Vagrants](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Vagrants.md "wikilink")
faction. They can be found in small groups accompanying squads of
[Blooded](Reaver_Blooded.md "wikilink") and
[Ironclads](Reaver_Ironclad.md "wikilink"), serving as their meatshields
during fights, or locked in cages within [](Reaver_Camp.md) or [Ark](Ark.md "wikilink").

Like other slaves, Reaver Slaves can become [](Slave_Recruits.md) if they are freed from their
[Prisoner Shackles](Prisoner_Shackles.md "wikilink") and/or [](Prisoner_Cage.md). During a fight, if one is able to
defeat their masters before killing the slaves, they will also have a
chance to join the player.

## Trivia

Due to a bug(?) it is much harder to recruit this slave type (though not
unique to this slave) when attempting to free them from their cages.

The bug causes slaves of Maniacal personality to be stuck in their cages
without attempting to join. As such, only Honorable or Smart personality
slaves can join the player.

The 'bandit types' personality these slaves possess never allows them to
be Honorable, and only be rarely Smart, with every other personality
having an equal chance of appearing. Because of this, it is very hard to
recruit them from the reaver camps.

Slaves freed by killing their patrolling reaver masters are unaffected.

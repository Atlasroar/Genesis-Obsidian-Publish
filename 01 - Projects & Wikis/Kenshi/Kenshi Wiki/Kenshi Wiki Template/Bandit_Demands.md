**Bandit Demands** is an [event](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Events.md "wikilink") sent by the [](Dust_Bandits.md) to extort money from players who
settle near their territory. It can trigger as long as the player has a
[base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 4,500 meters of
one of their locations or camps, and the [](Dust_King.md) is not dead (unlike many [](World_States.md) this means actually dead, not just
imprisoned). ![](Bandit_Demands_Range.jpg "Bandit_Demands_Range.jpg")

It will have a 20% chance each day to trigger if the player's base is
within 2,000 meters of a location or [camp](Dust_Bandit_Camp.md "wikilink")
owned by the [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandits.md "wikilink"), this chance will
scale down with distance until it hits 0% chance at 4,500 meters away.

Once triggered, the [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandits.md "wikilink") will send a
campaign to the player's base. This campaign will consist of one or two
squads, each made up of 6-10 [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandit.md "wikilink"), 1-4
[Dust Bandit Bowmen](Dust_Bandit_Bowman.md "wikilink"), and led by a [](Dust_Boss.md).

When the campaign arrives the War Leader will begin shouting at the
player to come speak with them. If spoken to, the Bandits will demand
that the player pay 2,000 cats to avoid being attacked. If the player
agrees to pay, another Bandit Demands event will be triggered in 42-56
hours.

If the player ignores them or refuses to pay, the campaign will assault
the player's outpost, breaking gates and attacking any player characters
they come across. If the assault is defeated, another Bandit Demands
event has a 50% chance to trigger in 50-80 hours. If the assault defeats
the player, a new Bandit Demands event will be triggered in 40-50 hours.

In the dialog with the War Leader, the player also has an option to stab
the War Leader. If this is done, the campaign will immediately retreat,
and a [Bandit Rage](Bandit_Rage.md "wikilink") event will trigger in 20-50
hours.

Unlike most tax events, this event cannot be avoided by having the
forces killed by a third party, as this event has a short repeat limit
cooldown. Even if slain by a third party, it will simply come again
later.

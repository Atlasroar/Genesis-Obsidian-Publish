A **Small Wind Generator** is a [building](Buildings_List.md "wikilink")
which produces [Power](Power.md "wikilink") via wind. After the initial
cost of construction, Small Wind Generators generate power without any
additional resource cost.

Small Wind Generators currently produce +0.25 power for every 1% of wind
in the area, meaning a Small Wind Generator can generate up to a maximum
of 25 power generated.

Unlike the [Wind Generator](Wind_Generator.md "wikilink"), the Small Wind
Generator has an arbitrary number as a minimum amount of a wind required
(1.12 mph) and is able to produce power nearly 100% of the time. The
drawback to its reliability is that it has half the potential power
output of the Wind Generator and a mere quarter of the upgraded Wind
Generator II. Also unlike the [](Wind_Generator.md), the Small Wind Generator may be
built on the roof of [](Player-Owned_Buildings_in_Town.md), which might help if a
town has a weak power grid, or the if player is planning to use a lot of
power.

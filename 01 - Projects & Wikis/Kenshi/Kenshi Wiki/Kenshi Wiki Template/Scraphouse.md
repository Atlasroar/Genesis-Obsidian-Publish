The **Scraphouse** is a weapons/merchant shop located in an ancient
factory, just to the east of [](Black_Desert_City.md) in the
[Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink"), be aware of the [](Weather_Effects.md#Acid_Rain) surrounding the place. It
can be marked on a player's map by reading the **Old Treasure
[Map](Maps.md "wikilink")**, indicating that the bulk of the shop's stock
may have come from an ancient stash of valuable items.

The shopkeeper at this location is [Quin](Quin.md "wikilink"), who is often
talking with their partner [Dack](Dack.md "wikilink").

The shop is guarded by 8 [](Soldierbot_Guard.md) and 5 [](Security_Spider_II.md).

The Merchant offers a variety of mid to endgame goods which may include:

- [AI Core](AI%20Core.md "wikilink")
- [Engineering Research](Engineering_Research.md "wikilink")
- [Ancient Science Book](Ancient_Science_Book.md "wikilink")
- Exotic Weapon Blueprint, such as [Falling Sun](Falling_Sun.md "wikilink")
- [Edgewalker](Edgewalkers.md "wikilink") and [](Skeleton_Smiths_(Manufacturer).md) Quality Weapons

Although it's possible to [steal](Thievery.md "wikilink") those things from
the merchant, Dack and many of the guards patrol around the crates make
it very difficult to get away with a meaningful haul. A very high level
character on thievery and lock-picking is recommended. Many of the
general storage containers (including barrels, which are never locked)
can be reached from specific corners. These will only work if they are
either completely safe (e.g. from the outside of the walls, specific
corners) or mostly safe with a high enough stealth level. You can also
use complete darkness (some other corners where the guards' view is
obstructed) to your advantage. Note that the security spiders can spot
stealthy characters very quickly, In certain spots the guards' strict
patrol patterns can make it difficult for them to sustain eye contact
with a suspected thief long enough to trigger an alarm.

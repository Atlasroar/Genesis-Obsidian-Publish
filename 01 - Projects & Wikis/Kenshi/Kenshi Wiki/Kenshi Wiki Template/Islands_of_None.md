The **Islands of None** are located to the east of [](Howler_Maze.md) and north of [](Forbidden_Isle.md).

The only way to access the islands is by
[Swimming](Swimming.md "wikilink").

There are several wandering patrols of single crabs that roam the area,
with each island being separated by a path of shallow water. Overall,
the land itself is quite limited and the location is inconvenient for
travel due to being surrounded by water. Don't be mistaken by slightly
darker brown areas on the map, they are under sea level. Only suitable
place for building a base is on the two islands north east that contain
the necessary ressources for a self sustainable outpost. Lonely walking
adult crabs are good training for your soldiers, nothing more disturbs
you there.

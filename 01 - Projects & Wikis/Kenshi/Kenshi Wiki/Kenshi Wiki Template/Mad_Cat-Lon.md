![](Kenshi_-_Mad_Cat-Lon.jpg "Kenshi_-_Mad_Cat-Lon.jpg")**Mad Cat-Lon**
is the [exiled](Second_Empire_Exile.md "wikilink") last ruler of the
[Second Empire](Second_Empire.md "wikilink"), and one of the most powerful
characters in the game. He can be found sitting on his throne in one of
the domes at [Cat-Lon's Exile](Cat-Lon's_Exile.md "wikilink"). Upon seeing
a player character, he will say the following and attack:

When in battle, the 120 [Stormthralls](Stormthrall.md "wikilink") from the
other dome will rush to his aid. If they are taken out before engaging
Cat-Lon he will be fighting alone.

## World States

(Requires **Mad Cat-Lon** to be killed/imprisoned)

If **Mad Cat-Lon** is killed/imprisoned, static [](Iron_Spider.md) will cease to spawn in
[Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink"), while patrols of "skeleton legion
force- pre" (7 Legion (melee) and 2 Legion scouts) will all cease to
spawn and replaced with a larger patrol of "skeleton legion force
(post)" (12 Legion (melee) an 2 Legion scouts) with a "force speed"
"RUN" instead of "GROUPED" and doubled relative chance of spawn(relative
to other squads, for example: it will be twice as common as "Robot
spider group" or "legion thrall unit" and four times as common as
cleanser squads or "screamer unit").

The death/capture of [Mad Cat-Lon](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink") will also
allow the player to have dialogues to intimidate [](Emperor_Tengu.md) as a response to being called a servant
when allied with the United Cities.

## Tips/Info

- Due to Cat-Lon's race bonus he has an impressive 120 Heavy Weapon
  Skill. Thankfully his Ancient Samurai Armour reduces the damage he
  deals by 15% along with his combat speed by a considerable amount.
- Cat-Lon and his StormThralls lack any repair kits. As such any cut
  damage over 20 to a vital will eventually (Very slowly in Cat-Lon's
  case as he has 0.03x Wound Degeneration Speed due to his 100
  Toughness) take them down.
- Catlon prioritizes reigning over attacking intruders (Unless he
  finishes his speech) so you can attack him, quickly sit in his chair
  and he will stop attacking to find a new spot in his building the
  guard. Not very useful but funny nonetheless.
- If you save and load the save during Cat-Lon's dialogue you can skip
  it. Thus, preventing him from trying to attack you and calling his
  Stormthralls in. You can use this to your advantage to simply
  assassinate him without any resistance.
  - Extra tip, if you spam Assassination fast enough you will not even
    need to save and load. You can start with 1 Assassination and knock
    him out before his speech finishes. (Tactic used for the current WR
    Hardcore Catlon speedrun)

## Trivia

- Kenshi's [monetary system](Cats.md "wikilink") is very likely named after
  Cat-Lon.
- [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") might be aiming to encounter
  Cat-Lon, the evidence being his [](Bugmaster's_Map.md) that reveals the location of
  [Cat-Lon's Exile](Cat-Lon's_Exile.md "wikilink").
- It appears that robotic patrols instead of only increasing in number,
  scales up activity immediately after Cat-Lon is taken down with all
  patrols 'On the run', evidenced by the fact that all of them move
  faster and static patrols are removed.
  - Rather than causing an invasion when the leader is taken down such
    as the cases of [Esata](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") (causes
    [SK](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") to [invade](Kamikaze.md "wikilink")
    [HN](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")) and [](Hive_Queen.md) ([](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md) invading a significant portion of
    the world) or a diaspora such as the cases of
    [Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink") ([](Strayed_Paladin.md)),
    [Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink") ([](Samurai_Rogue.md)) and [](Hive_Queen.md) ([](Lost_Hiver.md)/[](Hive_Bandit.md)), they simply patrol the same area
    more fervently than ever. The could either indicate them going
    berserk, or trying to hunt down the one who took down their leader.
    Either way, it's going to be much harder to get out of the area
    unnoticed than when you got in.

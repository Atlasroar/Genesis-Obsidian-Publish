## Appearance

Mercenary Leather Armour is built from several different pieces of
leather covering most of the front chest, part of the stomach, with
several leather pads strapped on the arms and hands. Currently the
in-game model looks very similar to [](Mercenary_Plate.md) minus the shoulder guards, giving
less coverage to the arms compared to their plated counterpart.

## Comparison with conscript leather armor

Compared with [](Conscript_Leather_Armour.md), which on appearance should
be a white version of **Mercenary Leather Armour,** they do offer
different protection against blunt and cut resistance with the amount of
difference being variable, depending on the grade. Harpoon resistance is
the same or just one point in favour of the Mercenary version. The
coverage and the skill penalties are always the same. The value of
Mercenary armour is always higher than Conscript.

Starting the comparison at **prototype** grade, Conscript does not
provide any protection all, thus is Mercenary the better choice. When
quality is improved to **shoddy** grade, the Mercenary armour outclasses
the counterpart with 2%, 4% more blunt and cut resistance and 1 point in
harpoon resistance. At **Standard** grade, the Conscript version offers
2% more blunt resistance, at the expense of 1 point harpoon resistance,
making the armour slightly better than the Mercenary version.

Compared to **high** quality, they offer the same protection, expect
harpoon resistance. From **Specialist** quality onwards, Conscript
offers more blunt resistance, while Mercenary armour offers more cut
resistance. The difference in protection are 2% for blunt and 4%
cutting. At **Masterwork**, these differences are 4% and 5%
respectively.

As conclusion, Mercenary is better at low qualities, near equal at
standard and high quality and offers more cutting resistance at
specialist and masterwork, but at these grades, offers less blunt
protection compared to Conscript.

![](Tribute_Round_Range.jpg "Tribute_Round_Range.jpg") **Food Tribute**
is an [outpost visit](Events.md "wikilink") sent by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) to rob the food supplies of people
that settled up in their territory by force. It can trigger as long as
the player's base is within 1,500 Meters of a [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) owned location. It also requires that
the [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"), [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink"),
[Seto](Seto.md "wikilink"), and [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) have all not been killed or
captured, and that the player is not an ally nor an enemy of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

It will have a 15% chance to trigger each day if within 1,000 meters of
a [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") owned location, this chance
will reduce with any distance farther than that, until it hits 0% chance
at 1,500 meters away.

Once triggered the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") will send the
campaign to the player's base, this campaign will consist of 0-1 [](Shek_Scout.md) and 5-8 [](Shek_Warrior.md), and will be led by an additional
[Shek Warrior](Shek_Warrior.md "wikilink").

Once the campaign arrives, the leader will shout at the player to come
talk. If the player ignores the leader, the campaign will leave and the
[Return For Blood](Return_For_Blood.md "wikilink") event will be triggered
in 12-24 hours.

Once speaking to the leader, there will be a few options. If you accept
the tribute demands they will begin taking food from any food storage
containers in the base, and [](Return_For_Tribute.md) will trigger in 120-250 hours.
If you attempt to negotiate, they will insist that they set the terms,
refusal at this point will result in them leaving and [](Return_For_Blood.md) triggering in 24-30 hours. And
finally, if you challenge them they will leave and [](Return_For_Blood.md) will trigger in 24-30 hours, in
addition you will recieve a +1 relations with the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

If the tribute is accepted, each Shek will take roughly 10 items of
food.

Like most tax Events, if the campaign is defeated by a third party
faction like bandits or wild animals on the way to the player's outpost,
it will prevent any future tax visits from the faction until the
player's next import. This is due to the long repeat limit timer, and
the fact that it doesn't consider being defeated by a third party as the
player killing them. This can be exploited by purposefully luring
hostiles to the event's forces while they en route to the player's base.
Though in the case of the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") here,
it is possible to reactivate the tribute events by failing to defeat a
[Shek Challengers](Shek_Challengers_(Shek_Kingdom).md "wikilink") event.

## Tips

- This event can be cheesable by emptying all storages containing food
  before they reach the players outpost.

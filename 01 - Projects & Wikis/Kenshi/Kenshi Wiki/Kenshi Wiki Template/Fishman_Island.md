**Fishman Island** is a small zone south of the
[Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink").

Despite being an island, players do not have to worry about needing the
[Swimming](Swimming.md "wikilink") stat to enter this zone. The lightened
area on the map to the north of the island is the location of a bridge,
identical to the one found connecting [](Black_Desert_City.md) with
[Scraphouse](Scraphouse.md "wikilink") and the bridge found crossing the
[Wend](Wend.md "wikilink") river north of [](Blister_Hill.md).

## Tips

- Fishman isle has the highest crop yield for hemp due to its
  environment which has 100 Green and 50 Swamp. However, you cannot
  harvest more than 1 crop for each plant in a farm so it is a bit
  overkill. Any zone with 100% yield will do fine as well for hemp.

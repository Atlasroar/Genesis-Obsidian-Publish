**Disguises**, when used with the [Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink") skill,
can help your character avoid being harassed or outright attacked by
aggressive [Factions](Factions.md "wikilink"). Disguises can be especially
helpful if a character is an escaped slave, an ex-slave, or has a
[Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink").

Armour that is classified as a disguise will note this and the faction
it belongs to at the top of the item description in-game. Once equipped,
a player can look at their inventory screen and in the top right they
will see an indicator as to who they are disguised as, and the
effectiveness of that disguise based on certain factors. For example,
your disguise will be less effective if you are engaging with the
[faction](Factions.md "wikilink") that disguise belongs to, and the
territory you are currently in.

This system of disguises allows a player to get around particularly
detrimental diplomatic rankings, for example the [](Holy_Nation.md) are the main suppliers of animals
(produced at [Holy Farms](Holy_Farms.md "wikilink")) and as such having a
poor score will limit your access to them. A player can disguise
themselves as a [Holy Nation](Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") ally (if there is
such a thing) and trade with them. Be careful however, depending on the
effectiveness of your disguise guards may uncover your deception if you
stay to long or get too close.

If the character's disguise is blown, they will be attacked by whomever
discovered them, most likely raising an alarm. If discovered by the
[United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") faction, that character will
receive a [Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") for "uniform theft."

Be careful not to be disguised as a [Faction](Faction.md "wikilink") which
the local faction is aggressive towards (ex: slavers disguise near
factions opposed to slavery). For example, wearing a Holy Nation uniform
and walking into Shek territory will cause the Shek to attack, even if
the person wearing the HN uniform is also a Shek and allied with the
Kingdom.

The disguise system gives the player more subtle tools to access areas
and conduct covert operations without relying entirely on brute military
force or high stealth/assassination combination. Helmet, Leggings, and
Chest plate will usually provide 100% or near 100% disguise. However, if
the player is recognized before or during the disguise, there is a huge
penalty that gets applied the next time the disguise goes off cooldown.
Every time you are detected to be performing uniform theft, your
disguise will be "blown" until you wait about 250s. There will be a
penalty afterwards as well, as people now recognize your face, so being
meticulous in your covert disguise operations will increase the chances
of bypassing security at close range.

There is also a penalty associated with using disguises from one faction
and then going directly to that faction's members. There is
approximately a 40% penalty, subtracted from the 100% optimal total. In
a sense, it would be better for you to don their ally's disguise, that
way they don't recognize your faces or think "I haven't seen you here
before". Certain factions have allegiance with each other, such as
Traders, Slave Traders, and United Cities. This allows you to use the
two other faction's uniforms to deceive the one faction, without
penalty.

Escaping as a slave is one way to use the disguise system almost
immediately. Even though there is an incredibly high penalty associated
with using disguises against a faction that has enslaved you (50% from
the disguise percentage), it can still pass you through a gate
checkpoint depending on luck and stealth. You will need to "knock out"
any member of that faction, that utilizes a uniform, and don enough
pieces to reach 100% disguise.

Be aware that there is a risk to using a faction uniform disguise even
if that faction is neutral or allied to you, because even using one
single piece of equipment will draw aggro if they discover it. Walking
around with one piece of equipment because the stats are good, is not a
good idea as it will make your disguise be blown very easily.

When disguised, your player is recognized as a member or ally of that
faction and will have green mouse icons on that faction's members,
signifying ally status. They will defend you or heal you, and you can...
do whatever you want while the deception holds. In fact, when disguised,
when you engage sneak mode, you will trigger detection arrows from your
own player faction members, as they are now considered to be "neutrals".
This will not un-stealth you but it may cause some fear factor.

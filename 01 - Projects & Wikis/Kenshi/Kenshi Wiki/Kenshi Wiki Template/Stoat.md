the south-west of [The Great Desert](The_Great_Desert.md "wikilink")

east through the desert. It can be discovered by travelling or by
acquiring and reading the [**Map**](Maps.md "wikilink") **of the United
Cities (Central Territories)**.

At one of the corner of the town houses wind generators and a bunch of
camp beds that are most likely slums for the homeless to sleep
constructed by the government or [peasants](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md "wikilink")
themselves.

[Lord Inaba](Lord_Inaba.md "wikilink") governs from the Noble House in this
town.

**Hamut** is a [unique recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink") whose wife
was taken by slavers. He can rarely be found in a bar in
[Clownsteady](Clownsteady.md "wikilink"), [](Drifter's_Last.md), or more commonly in
[Shark](Shark:_Swamp_Town "wikilink"). He is a potential recruit,
costing nothing provided the interacting character opposes slavery. He
can also spawn in other [UC](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") bars.

He will spawn with the Honorable [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

Hamut does not appear to track the player's stance on slavery after
recruitment, and does not attack slavers unprovoked. (0.95.11)

## Backstory

Hamut's opposition to slavery stems from his wife being taken as a
slave. He has apparently contacted the Anti-Slavery Guild named
[Spring](Spring.md "wikilink"), who failed to save his wife, and refused to
recruit Hamut. Depending on the conversation choices, Hamut can state
that he knows his wife is dead, or imply that he believes she can still
be saved. It is unclear which statement is true. Hamut does not refer to
the site of his wife's incarceration by name- only mentioning that it is
a mine. It is not currently known if Hamut's wife exists as an NPC in
the game.

## Dialogue

When Hamut is traveling with [Miu](Miu.md "wikilink"), he might say:

Hamut: This scent... it reminds me of her...

Miu: I'm sorry about your wife, Hamut. Slavers, they're the scum of the
earth.

Hamut: And I'm sorry about your time in the mines... I won't let them
take you again

Miu: We'll take them down one day, Hamut. You and me, together.

A **Topper** is a [Katana Class](Katanas.md "wikilink") weapon that is
aimed to inflict more blunt damage and sacrifice some cutting damage.
While it has the same reach as the [Nodachi](Nodachi.md "wikilink"), it
does not have the penalties or bonuses it has. This makes it a better
choice for those trying to avoid them. The Topper is the only Katana
without a Robotic damage reduction and also happens to have the lowest
Armour Penetration debuff of the weapon class.

You can find the [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") model of this weapon on
[Rhinobot](Rhinobot.md "wikilink") in [](Ashland_Dome_II.md).

This weapon has inventory dimensions of **1x9**, meaning it can only be
equipped as a primary weapon.

**Tax Man Visit** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") sent by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) that triggers if the player creates an
outpost within 3,500 meters of their towns. It cannot trigger if the
player is an ally of the [Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") or
[United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), an enemy of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), or if [](Emperor_Tengu.md) is killed or captured.
![](Tax_Man_Visit_Range.jpg "Tax_Man_Visit_Range.jpg") It has a 50%
chance to trigger each day if within 2,200 meters of a [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) owned location, this chance will
reduce with distance until it reaches 0% chance at 3,500 meters.

Once triggered, the United Cities will send the campaign to the player's
base, this campaign will consist of 3-6 [Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"),
led by a [Samurai Sergeant](Samurai_Sergeant.md "wikilink").

Once the campaign arrives, the leader with shout at the player,
demanding they speak with them. If ignored, the campaign will leave and
a [Tax Evasion Enforcement](Tax_Evasion_Enforcement.md "wikilink") event
will be triggered in 12-60 hours.

Once spoken to, there will be several questions and paths through the
dialog. You can pay the taxes for 3,000 cats, which will cause the
campaign to leave and trigger the [](Tax_Collector.md) event in 140-160 hours. If you say
you can't afford it, the campaign will leave and return in 60-72 hours,
demanding instead 4,500 cats. All other attempts to avoid paying taxes
will fail, and refusal to pay will result in a [](Tax_Evasion_Enforcement.md) event triggering in
24-48 hours, or 48-72 hours if you attack the Tax Man during the
conversation.

Like most tax Events, if the campaign is defeated by a third party
faction like bandits or wild animals on the way to the player's outpost,
it will prevent any future tax visits from the faction until the
player's next import. This is due to the long repeat limit timer, and
the fact that it doesn't consider being defeated by a third party as the
player killing them. This can be exploited by purposefully luring
hostiles to the event's forces while they en route to the player's base.

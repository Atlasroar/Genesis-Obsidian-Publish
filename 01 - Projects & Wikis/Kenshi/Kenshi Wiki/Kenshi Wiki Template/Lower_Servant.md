**Lower Servants** are [Slaves](Slaves.md "wikilink") within [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), usually working in one of the many
[Holy Mine](Holy_Mines.md "wikilink") sites.

Lower Servants are distinguished by their orange robes. Other characters
(such as [Hungry Bandits](Hungry_Bandit.md "wikilink")) that are caught and
enslaved are sometimes given green robes.

They are worked by [Slavers](Slaver.md "wikilink") hired by the Holy
Nation, as well as Holy Nation soldiers
([Sentinels](Holy_Sentinel.md "wikilink") and
[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink")) stationed at the mines.

The Slavers generally hurl insults at them, while the Holy Nation
soldiers prefer to remind them of the virtues of serving
[Okran](Okran.md "wikilink").

Lower Servants may be recruited once freed; they will follow the player
for some time, before engaging in dialogue. Given certain dialogue
choices, the Player can either part with them or allow them to join
their squad. Note that they will have the "Slave of" Holy Nation and
"Looks Like Slave" percentage tied to their character for some time
following their recruitment. Giving them proper armour and clothing will
help protect them until the two tags eventually go away.

Once the Lower Servants are in the party, you can turn certain pieces of
equipment Orange by placing it on the Lower Servant.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction.

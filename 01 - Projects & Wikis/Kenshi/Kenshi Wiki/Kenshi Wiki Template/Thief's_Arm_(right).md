Thief's Arm (right) is a [Robot Limb](Robot_Limbs.md "wikilink"), and a
replacement for a lost right arm. As the name suggests, it is ideal for
use by thieves, as it raises [Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink"),
[Thievery](Thievery.md "wikilink"), and [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink").
There are only right-handed Thief's Arms, which makes them synergize
well with the exclusively left-handed [](Steady_Arm_(left).md).

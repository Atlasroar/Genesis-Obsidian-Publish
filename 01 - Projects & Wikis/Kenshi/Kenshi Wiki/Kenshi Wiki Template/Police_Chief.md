**Police Chiefs** are the security chiefs of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md), and the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Free_Traders.md). They can be easily found inside of
[Police Stations](Police_Station.md "wikilink"), and can be asked about
bounty notices, offering bails, and reselling confiscated items.

Despite the loosening of the United Cities' grip on the southern
territories after certain [World States](World_States.md "wikilink") are
achieved, they still seem to assume the role of law enforcement in the
cities. This may be due to the lack of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md) presence in the south, leaving
security to be handled by the Police and
[adventurers](Tech_Hunter_Gate_Guard.md "wikilink").

Most of their dialogue is locked once the player has allied with the
[Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") (with the exception of the [](King_Gurgler.md) bounty).

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

## Â Trivia

- Police Chiefs head the Samurai Police, which have replaced the
  [Police](Police_(Alpha).md "wikilink") faction that existed in the [](Old_World.md).

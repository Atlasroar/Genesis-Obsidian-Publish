**Melee Defense** is used in armed combat. Equipping a weapon will cause
characters to block incoming hits. If no weapon is equipped, the
character will instead dodge using the [Dodge](Dodge.md "wikilink") skill.
Both are not possible - an armed character will always block (except if
attacked while stumbling).

The chance of blocking is calculated similarly to the chance of dodging.
It has a maximum 95% chance when your melee defense level is at least 21
levels higher than your opponent's attack level. Having additional
levels does not provide any additional benefits, but it may be useful
against more skilled opponents.

##  Training

Due to this skill being affected by [](Stronger_Opponent_Logic.md), an effective yet high risk
method of raising melee attack and defense quickly is by lowering your
combat skills. This happens when you equip a
[backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink"), various helms or some armours such as
the [Holy Chest Plate](Holy_Chest_Plate.md "wikilink"). In combat, when
your stats show a negative in brackets (e.g -10 from a traders large
backpack) this is the base used to calculate your experience gain.
Meaning, if you have 20 defence normally and find it is leveling slowly,
if you equip a traders large backpack it will be counted as 10. You will
then gain the amount of exp that someone with 10 melee defence would.
This is also true of Melee Attack. Please note that this will not reduce
the amount of experience needed to level.

Pieces of equipment that lower your combat abilities are cumulative, for
example a large traders backpack in addition to chainmail, the holy
chest plate and a tin can helmet would lower your skills by (-18).

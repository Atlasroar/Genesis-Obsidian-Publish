Requires Lady Kana to be killed/imprisoned:

If**Lady Kana** is killed or imprisoned then town overrides can apply to
a number of locations.

**Port North** will become destroyed, or taken over by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md) if [](Emperor_Tengu.md) and [](Lord_Nagata.md) are also dead or imprisoned.

[Bark](Bark.md "wikilink") will suffer food shortages and the inhabitants
become malnourished if **Lady Kana** and [](Slave_Master_Wada.md) are both killed or imprisoned.
Alternatively **Bark** becomes controlled by **Empire Peasants** if
**Lady Kana**, **Slave Master Wada** and [](Lady_Sanda.md) are all dead or imprisoned.

[Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink") suffers food shortages and
inhabitants become malnourished if still under [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) control and **Lady Kana** is killed or
imprisoned.

If **Lady Kana**, [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") and [](Slave_Master_Haga.md) are all killed/imprisoned, [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) patrols will cease to spawn in [](The_Great_Desert.md).

If **Lady Kana** or **Longen** are either imprisoned or killed, the
[Traders Guild Visit](Traders_Guild_Visit.md "wikilink") should no longer
trigger.

**Lady Kana** is considered to be one of the Northern Slave
Masters/Mistresses alongside with [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink"), [](Slave_Master_Haga.md), [](Slave_Master_Grande.md), [](Slave_Master_Ruben.md), [](Slave_Master_Wada.md), and [](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md).  Killing/Imprisoning any one of
them will cause [Anti-Slavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") patrols start
spawning in [Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"). Killing or imprisoning them
all will also further decrease [](Slave_Hunter.md), [Manhunter](Manhunter.md "wikilink") and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) patrols to none.

Requires Lady Kana to be alive and free:

If **Lady Kana** is alive and free while [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink")
is killed/imprisoned, [](Distant_Hive_Village.md) will become trashed ruins
under **Slave Traders** rule.

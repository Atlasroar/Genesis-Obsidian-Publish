**Deadlands Workshops** are large, hangar-like structures located in the
[Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink"). The structures themselves are
composed of two "walkway" areas along either edge of the Workshop with
one or two switchback ramps leading up, overlooked by [](Mounted_Crossbow.md) with spotlights. Along the
walkways are various machines, tool stations and containers ranging from
basic crates through to high-level locked chests.

This location is one of the few reliable places to obtain [](Engineering_Research.md). Similar locations are the
[Dead Workshop](Dead_Workshop.md "wikilink"), [](Post-Ancient_Workshop.md), and [](Workshop_Complex.md). All of them can be marked by
reading the **[Engineers Map](Maps.md "wikilink")**. There are 3
**Deadlands Workshops** in the region in total.

## Dangers

They are protected by potentially a [](Broken_Skeleton.md) guarding the centre of the site
and 1 to 10 [Broken Model 30s](Broken_Model_30.md "wikilink") manning 2
Double Barrel [Harpoon Turrets](Harpoon_Turret.md "wikilink"). Furthermore,
there is nearly constant [Acid Rain](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") in the
area.

## Item Spawns

This location has a gear artifacts value of 25,000 Cats and an item
artifacts value of 10,000 Cats, meaning it will spawn additional items
through the [Artifacts](Artifacts.md "wikilink") system.

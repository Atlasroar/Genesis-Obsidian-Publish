Equipment is a set of [Items](Items.md "wikilink") equipped to your
character. It includes [Armour](Armour.md "wikilink"),
[Clothing](Clothing.md "wikilink"), [Weapons](Weapons.md "wikilink"),
[Backpacks](Backpacks.md "wikilink"), and [Lanterns](Lanterns.md "wikilink").

The effect equipment has on Combat, [Athletics](Athletics.md "wikilink")
and [Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink") is determined by which class of
[Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") it is, or how large and bulky a
[Backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") is.

## Armour

### Armour

[Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") is clothing which provides armour protection
in battle. Heavier armour provides more protection, however it also
detracts from other [Statistics](Statistics.md "wikilink"), such as run
speed and stealth. Armour can be purchased from stores, stolen, or found
in ancient locations such as [Lost Armouries](Lost_Armoury.md "wikilink")
and [Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink"). After some researching,
armour can be created at a [](Leather_Armour_Crafting_Bench.md), [](Chain_Armour_Crafting_Bench.md), or [](Heavy_Armour_Smithy.md). The quality of
[Homemade](Homemade.md "wikilink") armour is exclusively dependent on the
character's [Armour Smith](Armour_Smith.md "wikilink") level.

### Clothing

[Clothing](Clothing.md "wikilink"), items which are primarily made of
[cloth](Fabrics.md "wikilink"), provide almost no armour protection.
However, they can be helpful for protection from [](Weather_Effects.md). Some clothing items may boost a
character's [Martial Arts](Martial_Arts.md "wikilink") stat or provide
protection for their fists. After researching the technology, clothing
can be created with the [Clothing Bench](Clothing_Bench.md "wikilink").

## Weapons

[Weapons](Weapons.md "wikilink") are the most essential item for your
character to have equipped. Every weapon class also has a
[skill](Statistics.md "wikilink") which is only leveled up while fighting
with that class of weapon. When characters are engaged in fights without
a weapon, they must rely on their [](Martial_Arts.md) and [Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink") to
stay alive.

Weapons can be found on almost all NPCs (non-player characters),
excluding enslaved characters and the [](Anti_Slavers.md). Weapons can be found in some ruins
(EX: [Shek Ruins](Shek_Ruins.md "wikilink")) and [](Lost_Armoury.md). Weapons can be sold to any shop
([Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink") may be necessary for stolen items), not
just a store which sells weapons.

Weapons and their blueprints can be purchased from [](Weapons_Shops.md). After researching the technology,
weapons can be created at a [](Weapon_Smithing_Bench.md). The quality of
[Homemade](Homemade.md "wikilink") weapons is determined by the grades
researched and the [Weapon Smith](Weapon_Smith_(Skill).md "wikilink") level
of the character creating them.

## Miscellaneous Equipment

### Backpacks

[Backpacks](Backpacks.md "wikilink") can be equipped by characters and
livestock. Some backpacks allow for items to be stacked while inside
them, noticeably increasing the amount of items which one character can
hold. Most backpacks severely damage a player's
[Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink") stat, except for Thieves Backpacks.

### Lanterns

[Lanterns](Lanterns.md "wikilink") can be equipped in the Belt slot,
helping players see in the dark. Vendors claim that they are necessary
when entering the [Fog Islands](Fog_Islands.md "wikilink").

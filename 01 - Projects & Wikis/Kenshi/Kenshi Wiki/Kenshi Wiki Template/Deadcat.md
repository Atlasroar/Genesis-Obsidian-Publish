![](Deadcat.png "Deadcat.png") **Deadcat** is a faction of small
villages and survivors located in the [](Northern_Coast.md) and [Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink"). They may
have once had larger settlements under their control, but they have
since fallen into disrepair thanks to the nearby
[Cannibal](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") tribes. Most have taken up the trade of
fishing in order to survive the harsh world. While generally good
people, times have been hard on them. It is not uncommon for them to
seem distant and untrustworthy of outsiders. They have been described as
"Rebel Descendants" by some.

## Trivia

- [Flotsam Ninjas](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") are allied towards
  Deadcat, while [The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") is
  seemingly aware (0) but neutral towards Deadcat.
- While Cannibals are hostile to everyone, Deadcat is one of the few
  factions that hates Cannibals.
- The [Cannibal Capital](Cannibal_Capital.md "wikilink") initially shows up
  as "Deadcat", which indicates that it has previously belonged to them
  before being overrun by the [Cannibals](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink").

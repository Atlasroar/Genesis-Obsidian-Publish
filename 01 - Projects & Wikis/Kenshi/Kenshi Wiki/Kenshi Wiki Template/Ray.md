**Ray** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink"). He is a mute
slave who can be bought for 1,000 Cats from [](Bar_fly.md) at either [Eyesocket](Eyesocket.md "wikilink") in
the [Stormgap Coast](Stormgap_Coast.md "wikilink"), or the [](Slave_Markets.md) in the [](South_Wetlands.md). Until recruited he is a member of
the [Outlaw](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Outlaw.md "wikilink") faction. If you kill Bar fly before
buying Ray, you won't be able to recruit him.

Purchasing Ray reduces the player's relations with the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) by 5.

Ray is mute because he has no tongue. He can't interact with any
shopkeepers or other non-player characters, although dialogue might
trigger on him if someone runs up to talk to him (freed slaves, bandit
leaders, for example). This is technically a bug.

He starts with [](Hive_Prisoner_Shackles.md) which are unlocked and can
be removed. He also starts with the 'obedient slave' task which means
nothing because he is owned by the player faction.

## Trivia

- Ray's name might be a nod to the head shape of all Hive Soldier
  Drones.
- According to [](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md) Ray has specific dialogue
  that can be triggered by a certain condition/interaction.
- As stated above, if you kill Bar fly before buying Ray, you won't be
  able to recruit him. The mod, [Recruit Ray by freeing
  him](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2455380086),
  fixes this issue.

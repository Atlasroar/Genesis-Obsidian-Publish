![](Whitebandana.jpg "Whitebandana.jpg") The **Bandana** is a Light
Armour that is equipped on the Headgear slot. The Bandana has two other
variants: the [Black Bandana](Black_Bandana.md "wikilink") and the [](Red_Bandana.md). This "blank" version of bandana is
[dyeable](Colour_Scheme.md "wikilink").

This armour has inventory dimensions of **3x3**.

## Appearance

The Bandana is a white cloth tied around the character's face like a
headband. It leaves the majority of the face and head exposed.

## Crafting



A bandana blueprint can be bought if one somehow lacks the necessary 2
Books for the subsequent research after unlocking the [](Clothing_Bench.md), however it is MUCH more expensive
than the books required. Crafting Bandanas is one of the more profitable
options for a beginning smith (tailor).

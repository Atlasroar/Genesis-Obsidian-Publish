**Ruka** is a free [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink"). She is
a [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") with no horns and can be found in a bar in any
[Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") town. She has a Brave
personality.

If you have human in the party, she asks if you are looking at her
horns, and after the obvious negative response, tells the player that
she survived, unconscious, to a battle she should have died in. She was
treated as a coward upon her return, and thus her horns were removed and
she was stripped of her status. She will join the player for free.

She spawns in either [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink"),
[Squin](Squin.md "wikilink"), or [Last Stand](Last_Stand.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

This [Waystation](Waystation.md "wikilink") is a small [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) outpost in the easternmost edge of the
[Stenn Desert](Stenn_Desert.md "wikilink"). Its residents include
[Mercenary Guild](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Mercenary_Guild.md "wikilink") members and
[Drifters](Drifters.md "wikilink").

This location is a good place to rest and hide after earning a small
[Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") from the nearby [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

As with all other non-ruined Waystations, this place has a 25% chance to
spawn pacifiers from [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), [](Traders_Guild.md), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

Just north of the gate there is a campfire with 3 [](Dried_Meat.md). This appears to be a left-over from
development of the game and is a mini-easter egg.

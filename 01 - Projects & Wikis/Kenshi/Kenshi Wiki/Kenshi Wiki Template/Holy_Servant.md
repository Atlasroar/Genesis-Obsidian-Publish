**Holy Servants** are characters in [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), often seen acting as the companions
of [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink").

They are higher-ranking, [unshackled](Prisoner_Shackles.md "wikilink")
slaves with more freedom than the [](Lower_Servant.md)[^1].

Instead of working in the mines, they patrol and perform shopkeeping
duties; [Holy Bakeries](Holy_Bakery.md "wikilink") in particular are
managed by Holy Servants. They can also be seen accompanying [](Holy_Priest.md).

Among the Holy Nation's enslaved population, only Greenlander men are
given the opportunity to become [](Holy_Servant.md) - possibly on the path to eventual
[citizenship](Holy_Citizen.md "wikilink"), although many Holy Servants are
drafted as [Holy Chosen](Holy_Chosen.md "wikilink"), and die fighting on
the frontlines against the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink").

Although they have more privileges than the Lower Servants, many Holy
Servants have [escaped](Escaped_Servant.md "wikilink") to join the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md).

## Trivia

- It's likely that many Holy Servants will later be "chosen" and become
  a [Holy Chosen](Holy_Chosen.md "wikilink"), which will in turn probably
  become full-fledged HN citizens.

[^1]: In the FCS, if you go to the "Holy Servant" character and check
    his references you'll see that he forms part of a squad named "Holy
    Slaves Conscripts", and in such squad, the slaves are precisely Holy
    Servants.

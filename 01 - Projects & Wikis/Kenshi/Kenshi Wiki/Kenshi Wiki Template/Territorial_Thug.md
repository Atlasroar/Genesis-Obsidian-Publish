The **Territorial Thug** is a randomly named member of the [](Stone_Rats.md) faction. One can be found in
[Shark](Shark.md "wikilink") and in [](Stone_Rat_Village.md). They are a bully who will heckle
passing by players, so long as they have a small squad (less than 6).

They have a Dumb [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

Speaking to them prompts them to order you to dance or do other random
favors such as bribing/gifting money, but also gives you the option of
hitting them. Being stronger than them when hitting them causes them to
be cowed and stop heckling you.

Talking to them an hour after cowing them causes a dialogue where they
can be forgiven or bullied.

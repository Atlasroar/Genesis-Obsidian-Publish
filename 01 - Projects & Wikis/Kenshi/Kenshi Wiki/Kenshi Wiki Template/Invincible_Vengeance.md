**Invincible Vengeance**is an [event](Events.md "wikilink") that can occur
when [Esata the Stone Golem](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") is
killed/imprisoned, and the [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md) is within 9,000 meters of
a [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") owned location. The campaign
will have a maximum chance of triggering of 50% each day if the player
is within 2,500 meters of a [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink")
owned location, the chance will scale down with distance until it hits
0% at 9,000 meters away.

The assault's forces will consist of 4-6 squads, each made up of 3-5
[Hundred Guardians](Hundred_Guardian.md "wikilink") and led by a [](The_Five_Invincibles.md). Amusingly, this can result
in more than five members of the [](The_Five_Invincibles.md) assaulting your base at
the same time.

Once the assault arrives at your base, the War Leader will give a short
speech that changes depending on various factors including the War
Leader's personality, the exact world states, triggered, and player
faction size. Then the assault will attack the player's base, and hunt
down any characters within.

If the raid is victorious, they will leave shortly after defeating all
your characters. If the raid is defeated, there is an 80% chance to
trigger an [Enemy Hunt](Enemy_Hunt.md "wikilink") event in 72-150 hours and
a 20% chance to trigger a [Shek Revenge](Shek_Revenge.md "wikilink") event
in 72-150 hours.

In the scenario that the player is somehow not hostile with the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) despite taking down [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) and fending off this attack,
after defeating it there will be a 60% chance for the [](Shek_Revenge.md) event in 72-150 hours, and 40% chance
of no retaliation.

**Skeleton** is a [Race](Races.md "wikilink") in Kenshi, best described as
sentient robots. There are many subraces of Skeletons. Skeletons heal 2
to 3 times faster than [Greenlander](Greenlander.md "wikilink")
[Human](Human.md "wikilink") characters and bleed at a reduced rate
compared to most organic races. They also don't experience hunger. They
are immune to all [Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") and
don't need to swim to pass through bodies of water or acid. Repairing
Skeletons uses and levels the [Robotics](Robotics.md "wikilink") stat.

## Subraces

There are [Playable Characters](Playable_Characters.md "wikilink") which
can spawn as a member of these races.

- [Skeleton (Race)](Skeleton_(Race).md "wikilink")
- [P4 Unit](P4_Unit.md "wikilink")
- [Soldierbot](Soldierbot.md "wikilink")

These races require [Modding](:Category:Modding "wikilink") to be used
as a player character.

- [Screamer MkI](Screamer_MkI.md "wikilink")
- [Skeleton MKII Screamer](Skeleton_MKII_Screamer.md "wikilink")
- [Skeleton Log-Head MKII](Skeleton_Log-Head_MKII.md "wikilink")
- [Skeleton No-Head MkII](Skeleton_No-Head_MkII.md "wikilink")
- [Skeleton P4MkII](Skeleton_P4MkII.md "wikilink")

## **Play Style Tips**

Initially, skeletons may seem like a difficult choice because of how
expensive [Skeleton Repair Kits](Skeleton_Repair_Kit.md "wikilink") are and
how much harder it is to find [](Skeleton_Repair_Bed.md) than regular beds. But once you
learn about the consistent locations where you can find repair kits
(South East Deadlands Armoury Ruin is undefended and always contains two
Repair Kits) along with how cheap beds are in Hive Villages (c.800) or
Black Desert City (c.200) they seem a lot easier. When repairing a
Skeleton, all bandaged health is healed at 250x their healspeed.
Skeleton characters experience Wear and Tear damage after being hurt,
meaning that their total health is lowered for the affected body part
equal to 4% of damage taken. So you would need to take 2,500 damage in a
single bodypart for the max health of that bodypart to reach 100. Wear
and Tear damage is fixed only through Skeleton Repair Beds, which can be
expensive in some locations but can be unlocked relatively early in the
Research tree.

Skeletons can make good [Martial Artists](Martial_Arts.md "wikilink")
because their fists aren't damaged when punch an opponent unlike the
organic races. Skeletons also take only 60% damage from Martial Arts
from organic races, Players need to take more care when selecting
[Equipment](Equipment.md "wikilink") for their Skeleton characters to
ensure they have adequate armour protection because they are only able
to wear armour in the "[ARMOR](Body_Armour.md "wikilink")" and
"[LEGS](Legwear.md "wikilink")" slots.

Skeletons can survive in any [Zone](:Category:Zones "wikilink") because
they are unaffected by weather and don't need to eat, thus eliminating
the need for an [Environment](Environment.md "wikilink") that can support
[Farming](Farming.md "wikilink"). Players often set their skeleton
characters to work on [Turrets](Turrets.md "wikilink") due to these same
reasons as well as because they have a higher vision range than most of
the organic races. (Scorchlanders are tied with Skeletons (Subrace
Skeletons) which also have a 1.25 vision range)

Due to religious reasons, [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")
hates all Skeletons. They will attack any skeleton character on sight.
This makes travelling in Holy Nation territory (located in the central
Northwest region of the map) slightly riskier for Skeleton characters
than characters of other races, who can pass through their territory
without much hassle as long as they have a Greenlander man by their
side. Skeletons are tied with Sheks for having the slowest run speed of
any playable humanoid unit meaning escaping from Paladins can be
difficult early on.

Players interested in allying with the minor Southeast Faction [](Skin_Bandits.md) should have a Skeleton Player
Character when speaking to [Savant](Savant.md "wikilink"). Even if not
allied Skeletons can use the Skeleton Repair Beds of the Skin Bandits
and Skeleton Bandits for free.

## Trivia

- In the lore, skeletons can be "[enthralled](Thrall.md "wikilink")"
  through a process that involves removing their heads. This appears to
  turn them into a mechanical "zombie" of sorts, as Thralls are
  essentially slaves with no individuality (skeletons cannot be
  enthralled by the player).
- Although extremely long-lived, they have limited memory, which is the
  reason they usually reset themselves every few centuries. Skeletons
  that don't do this are at a constant risk of losing their sanity.
  However, it is hinted by [Iyo](Iyo.md "wikilink") that they remember the
  past and the Extinction perfectly, but act as a whole to prevent
  knowledge of their involvement from being discovered.
- It appears that every Skeleton aside from thralls has the ability to
  drink Grog, given the abundance of Grog in several Skeleton-dominant
  areas.
- (Bug?) Unlike other races Skeletons cannot repair themselves while
  playing dead. However, you can get them to repair like normal. Without
  allies nearby when knocked unconscious (And Robotics is enabled as a
  job) save the game. Then load that save. When you wake up you'll
  repair yourself while playing dead. You can also trigger this by
  removing a robotic leg while in combat, getting attacked while getting
  back up which sometimes (10% chance) causes your character to play
  dead again and repair themselves or by getting picked up and dropped
  on the ground while still unconscious.
- Because of their robotic nature, when knocked out they will have
  "Rebooting" tag instead of "Unconscious". And their body fluid is
  listed as "Oil" instead of "Blood". This has no impact in game except
  visually.

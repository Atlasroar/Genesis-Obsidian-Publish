**The Swamp** is a large region between the [](Border_Zone.md) and the [](South_Wetlands.md). There is low visibility compared
to most other regions due to the areas fog and foliage density. The
region is fertile for hemp and riceweed farming. It also has an
abundance of copper and iron resources.

It is home to the [Swampers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Swampers.md "wikilink") faction and various
crime syndicates. The criminal gangs are: [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink"),
[Blackshifters](Blackshifters.md "wikilink"),
[Grayflayers](Grayflayers.md "wikilink"), [](Stone_Rats.md), and [Twinblades](Twinblades.md "wikilink").
The [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") control the city Shark and the village
Rot through lucrative hemp and hashish trade networks. Aside from the
Hounds, the gangs can be found in various surrounding swamp villages.
The gangs deal in [Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink"), which is illegal in
many cities.

Both [Red Sabres](Red_Sabres.md "wikilink") and [](Swamp_Ninjas.md) can be seen patrolling the Swamp, but
only the Red Sabres have a hideout within the Swamp while Swamp Ninjas
have a hideout in the [South Wetlands](South_Wetlands.md "wikilink"). Other
than the abundance of bandits, The Swamp is also known for a large
number of pests and hostile fauna such as [](Swamp_Raptor.md) and [](Blood_Spider.md), respectively.

## Environment

The Swamp has great 100% fertility for any swamp crop farm and the water
production is not a problem for most parts. 100% quality copper mines
dots throughout its landscapes and there are a reasonable number of 100%
quality iron mines. The stone mine is capped at 50% for The Swamp but
the amount of resources you can farm from other sources already make up
your loss in stone production.

Your staple protein would be found from the unique [](Swamp_Turtle.md) living here. Also, [](Blood_Spider.md) and [](Swamp_Raptor.md) are a common sight in the region.

### Weather

*This zone has the 'Swamp' season. Seasons may cause harmful [](Weather_Effects.md) or be purely aesthetic.*

## Tips

1.  The Swamp is a haven for squads with 30+ stats due to abundance of
    resources and the constant spawn of resourceful enemies.
2.  The main threat usually comes from [](Blood_Spider.md) harassing you while you are
    fighting other enemies and they come in random waves.
3.  Like most environments with lots of hostile wildlife, walling up
    your entire base is the best way to prevent disruption of work and
    to protect your people from unnecessary loss.
4.  Locking up [swamp turtles](Swamp_Turtle.md "wikilink") for target
    practice seems to be a good way to train.

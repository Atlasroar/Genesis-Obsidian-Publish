**Cornelius** is a [Goat](Goat.md "wikilink") [](Unique_Recruits.md). He can be found in [](Settled_Nomad_Village.md) in [Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink").
Nomad Animal Trader sells Cornelius for 15,000, but if you talk to his
owner, [Goat Man](Goat_Man.md "wikilink"), in a nearby Hideout building he
will offer you a half off discount!

As with all animals, he technically has levels in skills he cannot use.
These have no effect on him, nor can he ever raise them.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Goats can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving their
position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to another
quality of the weapon) The 18 in the cut calculation is from the minimum
cut damage (13) combined with 5 piercing damage which all Goats have.

<u>**Variant 1**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.77961008 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

<u>**Variant 2**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.83928 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

<u>**Variant 3**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.89894992 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt** **=** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

## Warning!

DO NOT leave the door open that he is in especially if you don't intend
on buying him immediately. There are many roaming squads of [](Scrawny_Cannibal.md), [](Starving_Bandits.md), and [](Escaped_Servant.md) that he will attack. Despite being
"unique" he cannot tank mobs by himself and once he leaves his hut he
does not return to his owner''s side and can easily die from bleeding.

## Trivia

- Cornelius has 1 Animal Skin and 7 Raw Meat as death items, compared to
  a normal Goat having 2 Animal Skins and 7 Raw Meat.
- Cornelius takes longer to reach Elder when compared to another Goat of
  the same age.

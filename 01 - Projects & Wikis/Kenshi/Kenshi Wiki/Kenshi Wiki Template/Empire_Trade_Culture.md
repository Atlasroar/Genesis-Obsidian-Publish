**Empire Trade Culture** is a [trade culture](Traders.md "wikilink") which
removes cultural items from [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and as well as other food items,
this culture applies mostly to [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink")
locations. It's not to be confused with the similar, yet distinct,

## Trivia

- Although the Empire Trade Culture forbids
  [Greenfruit](Greenfruit.md "wikilink")-related items, many nobles appear
  to have the privilege of eating [](Cooked_Vegetables.md) (as can be seen in their
  inventory) and [Emperor Tengu's](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink")
  "[Seal](Mystery_Sack.md "wikilink")" is also a Greenfruit. Some soldiers
  also appear to be able to give the player
  [Greenfruit](Greenfruit.md "wikilink") after they took pity/have been
  bribed.

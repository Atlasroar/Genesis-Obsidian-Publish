Shark is the northernmost town in Kenshi. It is characterized by its odd
layout and lack of completed walls. Nearby towns include
[Brink](Brink_(Alpha).md "wikilink"), [Catan](Catun_(Alpha).md "wikilink"),
[Clownsteady](Clownsteady_(Alpha).md "wikilink"), as well as an outpost to
the southeast. Shark is a part of [](The_Holy_Empire.md).

[Shark](Shark.md "wikilink") made it into the final release of the game as
a city in the Swamps.

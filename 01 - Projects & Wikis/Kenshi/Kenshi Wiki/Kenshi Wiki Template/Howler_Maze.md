The **Howler Maze** is an island connected to the mainland with water
covered land bridges to the north. The neighbouring regions are
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink") and [Gut](Gut.md "wikilink"). The island is
known to be uninhabited, but is instead dominated by
[Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink"), with a few escaped slaves wandering in from
the surrounding UC territory. A noticable amount of ruins are located
here.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") or [](Minor_Outposts.md) in the Howler Maze. This zone does
not spawn Camps.

to appears to be either a crater or volcano caldera on the south side.

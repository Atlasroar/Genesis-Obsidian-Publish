**Seto** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink") and the
daughter of the [Shek Kingdom's](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") ruler, Queen
[Esata the Stone Golem](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink"). She is given
to the player after the player has over 35 relations and turned in
either the [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") or [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) to the **Shek Kingdom**.
Alternatively, players can be given **Seto** after 80 relations.

**Seto** has a 20,000 Cats [Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") from [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md).

If the player is allied to [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md), [](Traders_Guild.md), or [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), Esata's dialog for awarding her will
be locked off, making her impossible to recruit.

She has an Honorable [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If Seto is killed/imprisoned there are several World States that would
trigger:

- [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink") would have a [](Town_Overrides.md) under Shek Kingdom rule with a
  notable lack of military population.
- [Hundred Guardian](Hundred_Guardian.md "wikilink") and [](Shek_Warrior.md) patrols will start invading [](Okran's_Gulf.md) and [](Okran's_Pride.md) regions if **Esata** is alive and
  free.
- If [Holy Lord Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink") is alive and
  free, [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") will start
  spawning counter-attack patrols at the [](Stenn_Desert.md) and [](Border_Zone.md) regions consisting of 1 [](High_Paladin.md), 4-6 [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink")
  and 6-10 [Holy Servants](Holy_Servant.md "wikilink"). Holy Nation patrols
  can also add up in these regions with **Esata**'s death/imprisonment.

## Trivia

- Interestingly, because of how the World States are set up,
  killing/imprisoning **Seto** while keeping **Esata** alive and free,
  and while the **The Holy Nation** leaders are also dead/imprisoned,
  can let **Shek Kingdom** spawn more warriors in **Okran's Pride**, so
  one can sacrifice **Seto** for the sake of stronger army patrols for
  the Sheks.
- If Seto is brought before Holy Lord Phoenix he will call her the devil
  child, and claim that he plans to have her purged in a ritual and sent
  to Okran, likely meaning he is going to have her burned at the stake.

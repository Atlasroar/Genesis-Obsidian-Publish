**Suspicious Settler** lives in [](Gatherer_Village.md), which is located to the west of
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink") and is part of the
[Deadcat](Deadcat.md "wikilink") faction. He has 2 unique pets called
[Beloved Goat](Beloved_Goat.md "wikilink") and [](Settler's_Pup.md).

Talking to the Settler leads to him begging you not to attack. If you
don't, he will tell you how his home has been raided by bandits. If you
offer him protection he will sell you his fish.The player can
alternatively choose to attack him. Attacking the Settler causes his
pets to come to his defense. Nearby fishermen won't attack, but they
will try to rescue the **Settler** while shouting "SURRENDER!" while
running away and carrying his body.

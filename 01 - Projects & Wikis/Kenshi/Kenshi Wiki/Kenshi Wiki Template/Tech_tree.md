[User:Skelliboi](User:Skelliboi "wikilink"): I made up a quick tech tree
based off of the wiki information as of 02/16/2020 I think it is
accurate for 1.0.40 build if it is not I can try to edit it at a later
date since I have been unable to find a tech tree myself in the 7 years
I’ve played I got frustrated and did it myself. I don’t care if you
spread it I’m not here for recognition I’m here as a lover of the game.

[User:FrankieWuzTaken](User:FrankieWuzTaken "wikilink"): Removed a few
research which no longer exist. Fixed some typos... Quite shoddily to be
honest but hey it gets the job done. Also moved Lockpicking 3 to
Technology 4 section as well as listed all materials needed for each
research. Lone researches with "," after an item means it uses the two
items listed. The lines show which research uses those materials. The
Red lines just split up some materials to make it less confusing.
Research with multiple "levels" like Advanced Battery Capacity show the
materials in order. So the first one is for the first level shown and so
on.

Major props to Skelliboi for making this in the first place.

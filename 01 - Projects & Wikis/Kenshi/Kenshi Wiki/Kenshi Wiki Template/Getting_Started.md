<img src="Moon_Run.jpg" title="Moon_Run.jpg" width="250"
alt="Moon_Run.jpg" /> Kenshi is an unforgiving game about a brutal world
which does not care about you. Many people will attack you in order to
loot you, [enslave you](Slavery.md "wikilink"), or [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md). You heal very slowly and, if you are not
careful, you can easily lose a limb. Gaining the edge over your opponent
is difficult since you do not gain skill faster than a non-player
character. This guide's goal is to help new players who are **Getting
Started** in the world of Kenshi.

## Game Starts

Starting the game, Kenshi allows you to choose a scenario, or [](Game_Starts.md) The information given for each Game
Starts is: Difficulty, Cash, Play Style, and a short description. On the
[Game Starts](Game_Starts.md "wikilink") page there is a more details on
what items, stats, and faction relations the starting character(s) have
as well as information about the starting locations.

### Difficulty

These difficulty labels refer to how your starting character's
circumstances will be at the very beginning of the game. Selecting an
easier difficulty Game Start will not make your character level up
faster than at harder difficulty.

### Cash

In Kenshi, all factions and vendors trade using coins called
[Cats](Cats.md "wikilink"). Some Game Starts begin with no money and some
start with a small sum of Cats.

### Play Style

Play Style is a label given to each Game Start. Play Style suggests to
the player what mindset they should have while playing their characters
in Kenshi. There are five different Play Styles listed in the default
Kenshi Game Starts: RPG, Action RPG, Real-time Strategy, Wanted
Criminal, and Trading RPG. You could play with those but they are not
"enforced", so if you choose a Game Start with the "Wanted Criminal"
play style, for example, nothing will stop you from turning your game
into a "Trading RPG."

### Short Description

Game Starts also give the player a short description to help their
decision making. These descriptions typically give you some context in
where your character may have come from, what items they have, and what
their starting relations will be with some of the [](Factions.md).

### Crew

During character design, you can choose the [race](Races.md "wikilink") of
your starting characters: (Bonuses mentioned are +20% XP and penalties
are -20% unless stated otherwise)

- [Humans](Human.md "wikilink") - Benefits include being the only race
  which can enter [The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")
  territory without being attacked by them on sight, the ability to wear
  all (Excluding Hiver Shirts...) clothes. All humans blood pool =
  75+(0.75)Strength level.
  - [Greenlanders](Greenlander.md "wikilink") - Bonus to Cooking, Farming
    and Science. Only race with no penalties to any XP rates. Normal
    healing speed and decent running speed. 100 all health, 1x Bleed
    rate and 1x Hunger rate.
  - [Scorchlanders](Scorchlander.md "wikilink") - Bonus to Armoursmithing,
    Athletics, Dexterity (10%), Dodge, Stealth and Weaponsmithing.
    Penalty to Cooking, Farming, Labouring and Strength (-10%). Fastest
    healing speed (1.1x Healrate) of the starting organic races and
    fastest non-Hiver. 100 all health, 0.9x Bleed rate, 0.9x Hunger
    rate.
- [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") - Bonus to Attack, Strength (+10%) and
  Toughness. Penalty to Athletics, Dexterity, Dodge, Farming, Labouring,
  Robotics, Science, Stealth, Thievery. Slow healing speed (0.8x
  Healrate) (Healrate x max hp is healing speed so they heal as fast as
  a Greenlander. However, blood regen and robotic limbs will heal 20%
  slower than Greenlanders) and tied with Skeleton for the slowest
  running speed. 125 all health, 0.9x Bleed rate, 1.25x Hunger rate.
  Unable to wear some helmets. Blood pool = 75+(0.75)Strength level.
- [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink") - Actually has three specialized sub-races,
  unable to trade with Hive Villages, cannot wear boots and only wear
  Hive variant shirts (Same as normal shirts however they are cheaper
  and lack limb protection) and a few other armour restrictions. All
  hivers have the same hitchances on their body which leads to most hits
  landing on their chest. All Hivers have a blood pool of 50.
  - [Workers](Hive_Worker_Drone.md "wikilink") - Bonus to Athletics,
    Dexterity, Engineering, Farming, Labouring, Stealth, Thievery,
    Toughness and Turrets. Penalty to Cooking, Science and Strength.
    They heal pretty slowly (1x Healrate) due to their low max health.
    125 head health, 75 all for other bodyparts, 0.3x Bleed rate, 0.5x
    Hunger rate. Unable to wear certain helmets. Fastest starting race.
  - [Soldiers](Hive_Soldier_Drone.md "wikilink") - Bonus to Attack and
    Toughness. Penalty to Armoursmithing, Cooking, Engineering, Farming,
    Field Medic, Perception, Robotics, Science and Weaponsmithing.
    Relatively fast healing for a Hiver (1x Healrate) but as they have
    the Hiver hitchances they are prone to taking many hits in the chest
    making them less effective for combat than the non-hive races. 200
    head health, 100 all for other bodyparts, 0.3x Bleed rate, 0.6x
    Hunger rate. Unable to wear any helmets. Slower running speed than
    the other two Hive sub-races but still faster than humans.
  - [Princes](Hive_Prince.md "wikilink") - Bonus to Athletics, Dexterity,
    Field Medic, Lockpicking, Perception, Science, Stealth, Thievery and
    Toughness. Penalty to Labouring and Strength. Heals slightly faster
    than Workers (1x Healrate) due to their 80 all health, 0.3x Bleed
    rate and 0.5x Hunger rate. Starts out slower than Workers but once
    you reach max level Athletics they move at the same speed.
- [Skeleton](Skeleton_(Race).md "wikilink") - Bonus to Heavy Weapons,
  Robotics and Turrets. Penalty to Dodge, Stealth and Thievery.
  Extremely fast at healing (2x Healrate) with a massive 200 all health.
  As healing speed is based on maximum health and healrate they will
  heal 4x faster than a Greenlander. 0.1 Bleed rate and 0x Hunger rate
  meaning they do not require food. Unable to wear boots, shirts or
  helmets. Requires [](Skeleton_Repair_Kit.md) to bandage cut damage. Bandaged
  Robotic health heals 250x faster than organic bandaged health so they
  are very fast at recovering. Their maximum health is reduced equal to
  4% of the damage that they take. This takes a while to actually add up
  and can be restored back to full in seconds by sleeping in a Skeleton
  repair bed. Higher chance to be hit in their chest compared to the
  rest of their body. Skeletons play an important part in Kenshi
  [lore](History_of_Kenshi.md "wikilink").

## Health, what's that?

You might start the game hungry. This will significantly affect your
running speed, etc. when your hunger is less than 200.
[Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink") and [Scorchlanders](Scorchlander.md "wikilink")
can eat raw meat, but other race starts will have to purchase
[Food](Food.md "wikilink") (in [Bars](Bars.md "wikilink") or [](Trade_Goods_Trader.md)) or cook raw meat with a
[campfire.](Campfire.md "wikilink") Since hunger is greatly debilitating,
slave owners keep slaves on the edge of starvation to greatly reduce the
combat and movement speed of their slaves. Your characters, including
animals, will eat automatically provided there is food in their
inventory (or that of their squad).

<img src="LoFi_Retreat.png" title="LoFi_Retreat.png" width="250"
alt="LoFi_Retreat.png" />You will most likely perish from your first
fight in Kenshi. Animals, or people wielding swords will quickly cut you
down, and you will die if there is no one to perform first aid.
Characters with untreated wounds may die quickly, as cut-injuries
progressively worsen at a faster rate. [Damage](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Damage.md "wikilink") to
the head, chest and stomach is particularly fatal and all cut damage
must be patched up using [medical items](Medical_Items.md "wikilink") such
as bandages or repair kits. Splint kits (for fractured bones) may be
used after bandages to be able to use a limb when it is below 0 health
provided you are skilled enough to splint to that point. Characters heal
fastest in a [Bed](Bed.md "wikilink") (x8 organic healing speed), [](Skeleton_Repair_Bed.md) (8x robotic healing speed)
or a [Camp Bed](Camp_Bed.md "wikilink") (4x organic healing speed). See
[Guide to Health.](Guide_to_Health.md#Healing "wikilink")

Starting characters which are Skeletons can only be healed with variants
of the [Skeleton Repair Kits](Skeleton_Repair_Kit.md "wikilink") or by
using a Skeleton Repair Bed. These beds can be rented only in very
specific shops (check the [](Skeleton_Repair_Bed.md) page for a full list) and are
generally around c.200-c.3,000 Cats per use. Some locations have free
Skeleton Repair Beds. Repairing skeletons can be expensive early on, but
Repair Kits can be found in many ruins including undefended ones. (The
Armoury Ruin in the South East of the Deadlands has 2 as an example)

## Allies

In towns, many characters can be talked to by the player. These include
Traders, Recruits, Mercenaries, and characters who are just looking to
give information. When entering towns, your characters may also be
stopped by the Town Guards. The guards will want to check your character
for contraband before you enter the town. Only a few items are
contraband so simply allowing this early game is the quickest dialogue
branch.

Being weak is less dangerous when you have more characters under your
control. There is a great advantage early on in having one character
hide away during fights so that they can run over after the battle and
bandage your unconscious or dying character(s) when it is safe to do so.
Having at least two characters can be the difference between dying and
being heavily injured.

### Recruits

<img src="LoFi_Group_Photo.png" title="LoFi_Group_Photo.png" width="250"
alt="LoFi_Group_Photo.png" /> There are three ways which [](Playable_Characters.md) are categorized: [](Generic_Recruits.md), [](Unique_Recruits.md), and [](Slave_Recruits.md). Bar Recruits and most Unique
Recruits can be found in towns. These Recruits will usually be in Bars
but can also be patrolling the town. They will ask for a set amount of
Cats in order to join your squad. Some Unique Recruits will join for
free. When recruiting characters, the game may open the Character
Customization module where you can decide to change their name and their
appearance.

### Mercenaries

Most Recruits are weak and don't have good equipment. For a couple days
at a time, you can recruit Mercenaries to protect your characters. These
Mercs will charge 2,000 Cats per day. Mercenaries can be found in Bars,
Mercenary Camps, or roaming the world in certain regions. Mercenaries
include [Cannibal Hunters](Cannibal_Hunter.md "wikilink"), [](Bar_Thug.md),
[Mercenaries](Mercenary_Captain.md "wikilink"), or [](Drifter.md).

### Animal Recruits

Animals make great recruits, but there is a drawback or two. The weaker
bandit factions will usually butcher your animal for meat if they see it
unconscious. Also, movement speed for animals is based on age of the
animal, more than the athletics XP that the animal has gained. There's a
list of animals for purchase [here.](Guide_to_Animals.md "wikilink")

## Equipment

![](Weapons_Graphic.png "Weapons_Graphic.png") At the start of the game,
you can use all weapons, and all equipment, if you have the strength to
use them, although you will start with low-quality equipment. High level
equipment will be quite heavy, making it impossible to run, or swing a
sword quickly in the beginning of the game.

Characters have two weapon slots named "Weapon 1" and "Weapon 2." To use
a particular weapon, put it in the topmost position.
[Crossbows](Crossbows.md "wikilink") will be used if the "Ranged" button is
activated, and if you have ammo. If a character is using a weapon with
an indoor penalty and goes indoors, they will automatically switch to
Weapon 2 if they have one. If using a 2handed weapon like a Heavy Weapon
or Polearm and a characters left arm goes below 0 health they will use
their sidearm, or just start using Martial Arts if one is not equipped.
See [Guide To Equipment.](Guide_to_Equipment.md#Weapons "wikilink")

### Scavenging

Often, squads from [Hostile Factions](Hostile_Factions.md "wikilink") will
attempt to raid a town. After the town guards beat these characters
unconscious, you should safely be able to loot them. Although, be
careful not to loot any unconscious townspeople because stealing from
them will be a crime. Stealing from bandits is not an issue though. Wear
whatever armour is the highest quality among them and sell everything
else that the bandits had. Beware that town guards will notice you
wearing their faction's uniform and will attack you, so do not wear any
clothing in towns you stole from a guard if it has the faction uniform
tag. If you dress completely in faction gear, you're in disguise, and
you might pass, if your stealth skill is high.

### Purchasing from Shops

Buying equipment from shops is the most legitimate way of acquiring
these items from a legal standpoint. From a financial standpoint
however, it is the worst. The difference between price and sell price on
equipment is very discouraging. However, having any armour is better
than none. Purchase the lowest quality option you can find in stores
(prototype or shoddy) of [Light Armour](Light_Armour.md "wikilink"). Early
game, light armour is the best because it allows for characters with low
[Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") to be protected and it can often have
bonuses to Combat [Stats](Statistics.md "wikilink"). Wear Light or [](Medium_Armour.md) until your stats improve and wear
[Wooden Sandals](Wooden_Sandals.md "wikilink") as most shoes will harm your
ability to flee from danger.

### Stealing from Shops

[Stealing](Thievery.md "wikilink") allows for you to get higher quality
equipment early game. Train up your Thievery skills before attempting to
steal from a shop because after you are caught stealing, you will never
be able to legitimately purchase from that shop again. The shopkeepers
remember your entire player faction, so sending in a completely
different character will make no difference.

In order to avoid getting caught stealing, you should enter the shop in
Stealth mode and hide behind furniture like a wooden wall in order to
stay out of sight. Wait until night. The shopkeeper will lock the door
to the building, and, eventually, the shopkeeper and shop guards will go
to sleep as long as the building has beds for all of them. If you are
caught staying in the shop after closing time, the shopkeeper will tell
you to leave many times before you are charged with trespassing and the
guards attack you. While everyone is sleeping, go around picking up
items on shelves to build up Thievery before attempting to steal from
containers. It may be beneficial to unlock the door before attempting
any stealing but make sure not to open the door because that may result
in patrolling town guards entering. If you are caught stealing, open the
door and run or remain and fight.

## Combat Mode

On the right side of the HUD interface, you will see seven buttons:
block, hold, passive, jobs, ranged, taunt, sneak. These buttons apply to
individuals in your squad and affect their current goals.

- BLOCK -- Never swing but can still face off. This person gains 20 to
  defense skills (Melee defense, Dodge)
  - If a unit is crippled, they will still attempt to punch attackers
    even when BLOCK is enabled. Units with BLOCK enabled will still fire
    ranged weapons provided RANGED is enabled as well.
- HOLD -- Don't run out, when combat is nearby. Also affects the first
  aid job.
- PASSIVE -- Will only act in self-defense when attacked. Will not
  attack characters not acting them first.
- JOBS -- The character won't do automated work in base when this is
  off. Does not affect the first aid jobs.
- RANGED -- Cossbows/Mounted crossbows/Harpoons won't be used when this
  is off.
- TAUNT -- Increases the threat of this character, leading enemies to
  focus their attacks here. (Threat seems to be affected by damage
  output as well as distance from a target so this will not always work
  similar to taunting in other games)
- SNEAK -- When activated, the character will attempt to go into
  stealth. Depending on light, skills, equipment, movement, enemy vision
  range multiplier, line of sight, etc, this may be unsuccessful. If
  enabled when playing dead characters may crawl instead of standing up.

The default settings are to activate the Jobs and Ranged buttons. When
all of your squad is downed, you may find it useful to engage passive
and sneak-to allow the enemy to win, and walk away, otherwise your
characters with high toughness will stand up and continue the fight. In
such situations, it's also important to hold the first aid job, since
characters will go to heal, and stop playing dead. Skeletons can heal
while staying low, but only after an order (Bug. They should behave like
other races) is belayed by that character.

## Crime and Belligerence

Kenshi has a realistic system for crimes and combat. The system works
well, although it's not clear why you're being attacked, and why you're
being flagged as a criminal.

Minor crimes include assault and trespassing. You can commit these
crimes freely and avoid the bounty by running away before you're seen.
If you're seen, an alarm is raised, and guards will rush to arrest you.
If you resist arrest, you'll have an assault charge as well. It's often
helpful to jump into a jail cell, at which point you'll lose your
weapons, and run the risk of being enslaved. If you evade arrest, you'll
have a small bounty put on you, which should expire in hours.

Major crimes are theft and kidnapping. If they catch you for theft,
you'll lose a bit of standing with the faction, and the vendor will be
permanently unavailable to you. Kidnapping is also serious-you'll get a
c.5,000 bounty for kidnapping or trying to free a slave.

In the wasteland, the wastes keep their secrets because there's no major
faction to report the crimes. You can commit as many crimes as you want,
and nobody can report them. Your actions aren't free of consequence
though. Your aggression (see the next paragraph) might make individual
NPCs or entire factions hostile to you. Hostile factions can't freely
attack you in cities, unless your "committing crime" is still flagged,
or if that faction is allied to the city.

Aggression is completely separate. You might be flagged for aggression,
(the cursor turns RED, when you hover over a person) if you previously
attacked them, etc. They won't necessarily attack you, but they
could-even if your criminal flagging is gone. The aggression flag should
go away in five hours.

Wearing stolen faction clothing is usually a crime. Don't wear it. For
some reason, it's nearly impossible to sneak into a city as an escaped
slave, which seems odd, since your bounty and aggression flags are
ignored by most NPCs.

## Training Skills

These are the most recommended strategies for increasing character
[Statistics](Statistics.md "wikilink") early game. For a more exhaustive
guide to training, read our [](Guide_to_Training_Statistics.md).

### Combat Skills

Before fighting, characters can easily train up on
[Strength](Strength.md "wikilink"), which will help during combat. The
fastest way to train Strength is through having a heavy inventory and
carrying another character. After doing this, your character will be
heavily weighed down and will walk very slowly. Training this way
requires your character to walk around while carrying this weight. You
can tediously click around town to move or simply find a character which
is patrolling the town and follow them through holding right click.

Some buildings will have [Training Dummies](Training_Dummy.md "wikilink")
for characters to train [Melee Attack](Melee_Attack.md "wikilink") with.
Using these will likely be a crime, as they are privately owned by the
faction which owns the building. Train on them for a little while until
someone starts to yell at you. If you continue to use their private
equipment after many warnings, they will attack you. Please note that
training your attack this way will result in less Dexterity experience
in the future. (As Dexterity uses attack level to multiple it's XP gain
in combat)

You can safely and easily gain experience by attacking alongside town
guards when bandit raids occur. The guards will undoubtedly defeat the
enemy squad. In order to decrease time waiting for a squad to attack
your town, run outside of town to find a group of enemies and lead them
back to the town. Once you are close enough to the gates, the guards
will come to your defense.

After these fights, healing these bandits and town guards is an easy way
to increase your [Field Medic](Field_Medic.md "wikilink") statistic.
Healing a character results in a minor relations boost with that
faction. Depending on their faction, some bandits may carry a Basic
First Aid Kit, you can easily loot this First Aid Kit before healing
them. Either way, you shouldn't worry too much about wasting resources
on as the field medic experience gained is, in the long-run,
*very*beneficial. You can easily loot their First Aid Kit before healing
them.

### Thievery Skills

Before stealing anything from an indoors location, characters should
train [Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink"). Stealth can be trained by entering
Stealth mode by clicking the Stealth button in the [](Guide_to_UI_and_Controls.md). Characters will gain
Stealth experience as long as they are walking around near other
characters. You gain hardly any stealth XP for sneaking near neutrals.
You'll gain MUCH more near hostiles. The more hostiles the faster you
will level. A safe but very slow way to train this is by turning Stealth
mode on and walking around town for a while. Be careful clicking near
other characters, as you may accidentally command your character to
attempt an Assassination and that will probably be counted as Assault
which is a crime in towns.

![](Assassination.png "Assassination.png")\]\][Thievery](Thievery.md "wikilink")
can be trained by looting items from sleeping (NOT UNCONSCIOUS.
Unconscious units give no thievery XP) characters, picking up any items
which have a designated owner, and stealing from containers inside
buildings. You will only gain XP if the chance to succeed is not at or
over 98%. Before stealing from shops, you could steal
[Junk](Junk.md "wikilink") items in residential buildings as being caught
from those locations will not affect your ability to use the town's
shops in the future. Often residential buildings will have mostly empty
storage containers, to save time looking in every one you can find out
if they are empty by clicking on the container and reading its details.
It will specifically say \[EMPTY\] if it has no items inside it. Locked
storage containers will always have at least one item inside of them.

You can usually just sell those stolen junk items in town since most
towns have vendors of different factions within it who don't care that
the item is stolen. If you have trouble finding a shop in your town, you
can sell to the [Tech Hunters](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink") in one of their
[Waystations](Waystation.md "wikilink"), provided the stuff you are selling
isn't stolen from their faction.

[Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink") can be trained slowly on
[Locksmith Training Boxes](Locksmith_Training_Box.md "wikilink") which can
be found in a [Shinobi Thieves](Shinobi_Thieves.md "wikilink") Tower.
Remain in Stealth Mode while using those unless you have paid to join
the Thieves. In order to avoid the Thieves becoming hostile towards you
and affecting your ability to join them later, stop training on the
boxes when someone sees you. A faster and safer way to train lockpicking
is to go to places with cages like [Bast](Bast.md "wikilink") and [](Fort_Simion.md) or gates like [](The_Old_Prison.md) and many Ancient Labs with locked
gates. You can put yourself (Or a corpse) inside of these cages, unlock
them, rinse and repeat. If you unlock and open a gate and then close it,
it will relock allowing you to train lockpicking over and over as well.
You need a Lockpicking level of at least 58.31 to be able to open the
most powerful (100) locks.

Picking locks on storage containers is also a crime against the owner,
so stop your attempts if someone is looking at you. You are still a
criminal for 3 seconds after stopping your attempt at picking, so remain
hidden until you're convincingly innocent.

If your character is [enslaved](Slavery.md "wikilink"), it can be an easy
time to train [Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink") and
[Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink"). Maintain Stealth Mode for the entire time
and your character will increase slowly while other characters easily
spot your character. While locked in a Cage, your character should be in
range to pick the locks on the slaves locked up next to them. After
picking the lock on both your Shackles and your Cage, attempt a full
escape. Failed escape attempts make for
some [Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink") training as well because slavers
heal slaves after locking them back up. The primary issue with repeating
this plan is how long it takes for characters to heal while locked up,
making your character's Stealth ability cut due to injuries and meaning
that it may be a while until you are able to successfully escape the
slave camp.

Keep in mind that any illegal activity carried out has a "cool-down
timer" that ticks backwards giving the town's guard *some* time to spot
any crime and to initiate arrest. Stop any such activity *before* the
guards get to you.

### Trade Skills

Without having to build your own Outpost or do any research, you can
train in the trade skills of [Farming](Farming.md "wikilink") and
[Laboring](Laboring.md "wikilink"). Laboring can be trained in any region
by mining a [Copper](Raw_Copper.md "wikilink") or
[Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink") deposit. Farming can be trained on Farms
which are sometimes part of towns. Most notable towns with farms are
[Holy Farms](Holy_Farms.md "wikilink"), [](Drifter's_Last.md), and any town in [](The_Swamp.md).

## Money Making

You don't need money if you choose to steal everything you want, but
having money is still preferred to having no money. More ways to earn
Cats can be found on the [](Money_Making_Strategies.md) page.

### Looting

Characters which have been made unconscious can be stolen from easily.
This action can be risky if the unconscious or dead character has allies
nearby. Otherwise, all items they hold can be taken and sold in a shop.
As noted earlier, it can be dangerous selling stolen items to the same
faction where they originated. Players can lure bandits and other
hostile roaming squads to town guards regularly in order to save time
when using this method.

### Trading

Acting as a wandering trader is a viable option to increasing your
income. Most items have slightly differing prices from town to town. In
your starting town, purchase as many as you can of whichever item has
the lowest markup rate. Then wander to other towns where the markup
rates are high and sell them off.

If you are worried about traveling far from your starting town, you can
choose to simply become a raw materials trader instead. Through the
[Prospecting](Prospecting.md "wikilink") module, you can find the nearest
[Copper](Raw_Copper.md "wikilink") or [Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink") deposit.
Run to the mine and work at it until your character has a full inventory
of raw materials. Collecting from the mine will require either looting
it through holding right click or selecting it and opening your player
character's inventory. Take your full inventory of items and sell it at
any store.

Purchasing a [Backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") early in order to carry
more items would make trips more efficient. When carrying a backpack
(other than a [](Small_Thieves_Backpack.md)), make sure that your
character has enough inventory space to take off the backpack because
the backpack's negative effect on combat stats can be brutal early game.

### Selling Characters to Slavers

In the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") territory, you can sell
characters to Slavers from the [Slave Traders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink")
faction. An easy way to do this would be to find a town which is
controlled by the Slave Traders and wait until bandits attack it. After
the guards have finished the fighting, run out and pick up an
unconscious character. By talking to the [](Slaver_Boss.md) in the Slave Shop or by placing the
character in a [Prisoner Cage](Prisoner_Cage.md "wikilink"), you can earn a
couple hundred Cats.

This is a dangerous strategy choice because on the way to a town
containing a Slave Shop, you can be attacked. If you are knocked out in
United Cities territory and especially near Slaver controlled towns, it
is likely that a roaming squad of [Manhunters](Manhunters.md "wikilink"),
[Slave Hunters](Slave_Hunters.md "wikilink"), or [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) will enslave you.
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") is a location that also accepts slaves if
your characters [fit a certain criteria](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink").

### Bounty Collecting

Characters can be given [Bounties](Bounty.md "wikilink") easily in Kenshi
for committing many crimes. In many towns, [](Wanted_Posters.md) are sold at Bars and Police
buildings. The characters who have Wanted Posters out against them will
likely have high bounties and be difficult to defeat.

However, many roaming bandits can be spawned with a randomly generated
bounty of roughly 2,000 Cats. Be on the lookout for these minor
criminals. If you see one of them defeated by a different faction squad
and the coast is clear, run over and pick them up. Make sure that their
wounds are bandaged before picking them up, as you will not earn the
full bounty for a corpse. Carry the character to a town controlled by
the faction which has the bounty against them (you can learn this by
hovering over the bounty label when the character is selected) and drop
them off in a [Prisoner Cage](Prisoner_Cage.md "wikilink") in the Police
building.

Some characters known to have randomly generated bounties are from these
factions: [Dust Bosses](Dust_Boss.md "wikilink"), [](Grass_Pirates.md), [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md), [](Sand_Ninjas.md).

## Outposts

There is more to the game than bounty hunting, fighting, and trading. To
experience the rest of the game, you will likely want to build an
Outpost. It is suggested not to do this until you have a decent amount
of cats (If in United Cities territory) as well as combat stats as
raiders WILL be coming before long.

### Inside Towns

Inside towns, there are often buildings for sale which can become
[](Player-Owned_Buildings_in_Town.md). You can find out which
buildings these are by clicking on them and reading information about
them in the bottom left corner of the screen. To buy these buildings,
simply click on the "For Sale" button and confirm in the following popup
window. Some purchasable buildings are damaged and need repair after
purchase. They can be repaired by right-clicking on them and clicking on
the "repair" pop-up button. The required cost in [](Building_Materials.md) (easily obtained in most, but
not all, towns with buildings for sale) will be displayed in the next
interface box. Ruined buildings are cheaper in cats than normal
buildings for sale. Inside these buildings and on their roofs, you can
construct any interior type building (in game's terms - furniture or
other buildable items) and also some buildings labeled as exterior.
Having your own building in a town before building an outpost is good
because you will be protected by the town Guards while researching
[Technology](Technology.md "wikilink") and [Crafting](Crafting.md "wikilink").

### Building Your Own Outpost

Starting an outpost can be a poor choice early game because outposts
tend to attract raids and tax-collectors. If you feel that your
characters are ready to properly defend and afford their base, see our
[Guide to Building an Outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink").

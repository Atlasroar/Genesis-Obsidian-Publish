**Domesticated Bulls** are [animals](Fauna.md "wikilink") that can be used
for transporting many goods over long distances because of the [](Bull_Backpack.md) which they can carry on their backs.
There are other types of Bulls, such as [](Wild_Bull.md) which can be found in roaming groups, and
[Pack Bulls](Pack_Bull.md "wikilink") which can be found in [Trade
Caravans](Trade_Caravan "wikilink").

Domesticated Bulls can be purchased from [](Holy_Farm_Leader.md) found at any [](Holy_Farm.md).

Domesticated Bulls have 1.2 strength multiplier, and their cut horns
mean they deal less damage overall, with a higher proportion of it being
blunt. Additionally, they have less health on their head and heal more
slowly when compared to the other bull types.

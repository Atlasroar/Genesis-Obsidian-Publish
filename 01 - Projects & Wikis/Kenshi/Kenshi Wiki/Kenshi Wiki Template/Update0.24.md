**Version 0.24** introduced doors to Kenshi. It also rebalanced some of
the game economy and added tutorial windows showing for newcomers.

__TOC__

Seems I’m finished today.  0.24.0 is out!

Remember, if you have a version earlier than 0.22.0 then you will have
to download it again from here or the auto-updater won’t work.

## 0.24.0

Some of this will require you to start or import to a new game.

**WARNING!!**

- Price of trade goods has been reduced, I recommend you sell ALL your
  trade goods before you update the game.  The purpose of this is to
  fill up your backpack more, and try to put a cap on the upper income
  of a high level trader. I want the big money to be earned from
  buildings.

#### FEATURES

- Doors! Please report it if characters are getting stuck or doors are
  impassable etc. Doors cant be locked yet.
- You can no longer buy the higher grade armour and weapons. You will
  have to research and craft them later on.
- Price adjustments. Low level items are cheaper, high-level items are
  more expensive. Traders backpacks don’t stack so many items.
- New mouse pointers

#### BUG FIXES

- Big framerate increase for some people
- Still fiddling with the pathfinding/movement system
- Fixed that outpost in the north, now it has a proper crew
- You now have to be within 200 meters to trade items with someone.

## 0.24.1

- Disabled BUILD button. It was enabled by accident in the last release.
- There is a problem with savegame corruption that I'm trying to track
  down. Until then I've installed a backup routine that will import your
  squad to a new game, although you will lose your money, so it gives
  you 10,000 in compensation.

## 0.24.3

- Tutorial window appears on your first play. To bring it up use the
  "Help" button, just below the map button.

#### BUG FIXES

- Characters get stuck less often
- A crash fixed
- Fixed the screenshot overwriting bug

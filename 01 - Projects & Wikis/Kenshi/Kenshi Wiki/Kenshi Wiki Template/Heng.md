**Heng** is a [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") settlement built
on top of a rocky plateau, located southwest of [Heft](Heft.md "wikilink")
and east of [Tengu's Vault](Tengu's_Vault.md "wikilink"). Heng is connected
to its satellite-city, the [Trader's Edge](Trader's_Edge.md "wikilink"), by
a metal bridge, giving access to the [](Traders_Guild_HQ.md). This makes it the main trading town
for the [Empire](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") and therefore well defended.
You can find Heng simply through exploration or by acquiring and reading
the **[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the United Cities (Central
Territories)**.

It relies upon shipments from [Stone Camp](Stone_Camp.md "wikilink"),
[South Stone Camp](South_Stone_Camp.md "wikilink") and
[Eyesocket](Eyesocket.md "wikilink"). Therefore it is supported by more
slave camps than any other Major UC town, making it the town with the
most stable local economy in the UC.

[Lord Yoshinaga](Lord_Yoshinaga.md "wikilink") can be found in the Noble
House, being in it is considered trespassing. He is protected by many
[Hooded Empire Noble Guards](Hooded_Empire_Noble_Guard.md "wikilink").

This town is noteworthy for having a **Thieves Guild** where the player
could buy equipment for sneaking, and a **Robotics Workshop** where
characters in need of robotic repairs and replacements can go to.

The player can often time encounter [Harmothoe](Harmothoe.md "wikilink")'s
trade caravan in Heng or it's neighboring city, Trader's Edge.

There is a true wonder of the Desert region found in the mountainous
area just East of Heng - a small and beautiful lake.

## Trivia

- Previously, neither bars spawned any NPCs other than the barkeeper,
  disallowing any recruitment in Heng. This has been fixed in [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Changelog.md).
- Heng is the only northern town in UC that doesn't have any "camp bed
  slums".

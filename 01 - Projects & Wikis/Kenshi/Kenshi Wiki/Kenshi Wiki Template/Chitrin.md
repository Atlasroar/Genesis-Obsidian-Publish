Chitrin was a deity in the world of Kenshi whose story is described by
the [Book Of Sacrifice](Book_Of_Sacrifice.md "wikilink"). He is a lesser
known deity with only a single book describing his existence, and the
[Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") seemingly has banned his
worship (although they have the Book of Sacrifice in their
[Temples](Temple.md "wikilink")). Outside of Holy Nation Temples, the book
can also be found in the [Flotsam Village](Flotsam_Village.md "wikilink")
which makes sense considering [Moll's](Moll.md "wikilink") open ideas on
religion.

## History of Chitrin

The book describes Chitrin as a benevolent god whose people lost faith
in him one day. As the faith in Chitrin diminished, his power decreased
and the lands were plagued by calamities. The people begged Chitrin to
save them. In an act of forgiveness, Chitrin sacrificed himself to end
the calamities and was reborn as [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink"), the god of
day, warmth, and renewal, and [Narko](Narko.md "wikilink"), the god of
night, cold, and destruction. From then on, the two deities lived on in
balance.

## Trivia

- Some players believe Chirin may have some connection to another lore
  character, [Stobe](Stobe.md "wikilink").

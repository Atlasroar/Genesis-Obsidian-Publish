![](Lost_Library.png "Lost_Library.png") **Lost Libraries** are ancient
repositories of knowledge left to mold and decay, not to be confused
with [Library Ruins](Library_Ruins.md "wikilink"). Intrepid adventurers can
occasionally find [](Ancient_Science_Book.md) in these forgotten treasure
troves. Unless discovered by exploration, they can be found by reading a
**Tech Hunters Library [Map](Maps.md "wikilink")**.

These locations often contain maps revealing other [](Ancient_Locations.md), such as ancient military
bases. The second floor often harbours an empty [](Medical_Workbench.md) belonging to an [](Second_Empire.md).

They are sometimes protected by large groups of [](Blood_Spider.md).

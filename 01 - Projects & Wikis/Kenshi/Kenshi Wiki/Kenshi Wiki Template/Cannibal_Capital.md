Once the town of [Deadcat](Deadcat.md "wikilink"), it has fallen to
[Cannibals](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink"). It will appear in the map initially
as the neutral town of Deadcat, presumably to lure players there,
thinking it is a safe haven from the cannibal hordes following them.

The are a large number of [Cannibals](Cannibal.md "wikilink") and [](Scrawny_Cannibal.md) in the area. In addition, there
are at least 4 [Cannibal Chiefs](Cannibal_Chief.md "wikilink"), with two
guarding the Cannibal leader, the [](Cannibal_Grand_Wizard.md).

The [Captive's Journal Series](Captive's_Journal_Series.md "wikilink") can
be found in this location, inside the chests in the Grand Wizard's Hut.

**Moll** is the leader of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) and also the author of [](Memo_From_Moll.md) and [](Moll's_Speech.md). She has a large (50,000) bounty on
her head that you can turn in to the [](Holy_Nation.md), or you can choose to side with the
Flotsam Ninjas for a huge relationship hit with the Holy Nation. She can
be found at the [Flotsam Village](Flotsam_Village.md "wikilink") in the
[Hidden Forest](Hidden_Forest.md "wikilink") region, northeast of
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink").

She has a Brave [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

The three leaders of the [Holy Nation](Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") can be
handed over to her.

The wanted poster is incorrect with her actual (50,000) reward bounty.

If you try to turn her in as a woman or non-human, the inquisitor will
have you arrested as well, assuming this must be a trick of Narko.

## Interactions

If you speak to Moll for the first time, she will firstly complain about
the danger in this world and mention how
[Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") are good for target practicing in
which the player could either choose to respond with sympathizing with
the Cannibals, agreeing with her words, turning her down or simply
ignoring her.

After the opening line is over, the player can ask if she is the leader
of **Flotsam Ninjas**, in which she will simply respond that she is.
Giving the player a chance to attempt an 'Okran's Crusade', to move on
to other topics or to end the conversation.

The player can also ask why she settled up in the Cannibal lands, which
she will respond that it's because there is no influence from other
factions in this area due to the frequent swarms of Cannibals making it
a suitable place to set up a refuge base.

Another option is to ask whether Moll could join the player's squad, she
will respond with laughter and note that she has an entire army to
command. The player can then move on to other topics or act offended by
her answer, the latter response resulting in Moll insulting you and -1
relation points with FN as well as ending the conversation.

The player can also question if she is in the cult of Narko, where she
will firstly laugh and insult HN's teachings and then give her own idea
that HN is just one of many possibilities in a religion and say that
they fight Holy army because of those labels. She will then go on a rant
about religion if the player wants to hear about it, where the player
could choose to stop her and move to other topics, allow her to go on
the rant, or attempt an 'Okran's Crusade'. If the player allowed her to
move on on her rant, she will say that many of the ninjas that escaped
HN still believe in Okran but an aspect without good and evil, but to
her it's all nonsense. The player can then agree with her viewpoint
which will give the player +3 relation points with FN, ignore her or
attempt 'Okran's Crusade' (again).

The last option is to ask whether the player could join the revolution
of FN, she will then tell you to swear allegiance to FN in order to be
part of them, the player can then choose to side with FN (+75 with FN
and -75 with HN) or [Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink") (+50 with HN
and -75 with FN) or to avert the choice of decision, the 3rd decision
will result in Moll calling you a coward, where the player could either
ignore or act offended, the latter will result in getting insulted by
Moll and -1 relation with FN and ending the conversation.

If the player has allied themselves with FN, the player can then discuss
with Moll on how to destroy the Holy Nation. She will firstly mark the
position of [High Inquisitor Seta](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md "wikilink") and
[High Inquisitor Valtena](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md "wikilink") and note
that they should take out both of them first before taking out
**Phoenix**. The player can also ask for help from FN where Moll will
give you a piece of paper called [](Note_From_Moll.md) that will allow you to ask help from FN
patrols consisting of 4 or more individuals.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

(Requires Moll to be killed/imprisoned)

If **Moll** is killed/imprisoned it would cause **Flotsam Village** to
be taken over by [Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink").

(Requires Moll to be alive and free)

If **Moll** is alive and free while [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) and [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) are all killed/imprisoned,
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") and [](Blister_Hill.md) will fall under the control of **Flotsam
Ninjas,** and Moll will relocate in **Blister Hill**. If all 4 of them
are killed/imprisoned then both **Rebirth** and **Blister Hill** will
fall under the control of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md).

If **Moll** is alive and free while **High Inquisitor Seta** and **High
Inquisitor Valtena** are killed/imprisoned, **Flotsam Ninjas** patrols
will patrol in [Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink") and [](Okran's_Valley.md).

## Trivia

- Whether due to bug or intentional, **Flotsam Ninjas** patrols in
  [Hidden Forest](Hidden_Forest.md "wikilink") and [](Northern_Coast.md) will not cease to spawn or have
  signs of weakened patrols even after **Moll** is killed/imprisoned.
- Moll is the author of at least two book items in Kenshi: [](Moll's_Speech.md) and a [](Memo_From_Moll.md).

![](Lockpick_Training.jpg "Lockpick_Training.jpg") on a [](Locksmith_Training_Box.md)\]\] **Thievery** is an
important [Statistic](Statistics.md "wikilink") that affects the
character's ability to steal items undetected. It was introduced as a
skill in version 0.59, but the action was originally implemented in the
game during the 0.58 update. Experience in this skill is earned through
attempting to steal things which are risky. Characters earn no
experience when there is a 98% chance or greater of success.

## Uses

#### Selling Stolen Items

> When you steal an item from anyone it's now flagged as stolen when
> looking at the item in your inventory. If it was stolen recently, it
> will also list who it was stolen from, but this will fall off
> eventually. The skill comes in handy only when it comes to selling
> items you stole from a faction back to themselves and the chance of
> success will show up when attempting to sell the item. The selling
> chance is 100% when selling to a different faction, the hive, or the
> [Shinobi Thieves](Shinobi_Thieves.md "wikilink"). When trying to sell
> stolen goods back to the faction you stole from, the chance of
> succeeding is 20% + (0.42 \* Thieving)%. Most stolen items sell for
> half of their normal value.

### Stealing things

> Stealing items off the ground requires the player to hold alt. Picking
> up items which have their name colored red counts as stealing. Your
> character should be in [Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink") Mode to avoid
> getting caught. You do not need to hold alt if your character is
> looting someone's body. The chance is 100% if the item is out in the
> world. When stealing from a container, the chance of success is based
> on the character's thievery skill. The closer an NPC is to the
> container the lower the chance to successfully steal. Even if unseen
> and are able to successfully steal you will still need to wait a few
> seconds (Timer is shown at the bottom left above a characters name) to
> avoid notice.

## Equipment

You can use a [Thief's Arm (right)](Thief's_Arm_(right).md "wikilink") to
buff your level, provided it is at least high quality. Armour-wise you
cannot boost your thieving level, however there are many which boost
[Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink"), which can help you avoid being seen after
successfully stealing something.

### Naked

- When wearing nothing your stealth level is boosted by 20%.

### Headgear

- [Basket Hat](Basket_Hat.md "wikilink") boosts the wearer's stealth stat
  by 10% however, it is [Clothing](Clothing.md "wikilink") and does not
  protect the wearer's head.
- [Swamp Ninja Mask](Swamp_Ninja_Mask.md "wikilink") boosts the wearer's
  stealth stat by 10% as well as 100% protection from Duststorms and
  Gas.

### Body Armour

- [Assassins Rags](Assassins_Rags.md "wikilink") boosts the wearer's
  stealth stat by 10%
- [Ninja Rags](Ninja_Rags.md "wikilink") boosts the wearer's stealth stat
  by 30%
- [Dustcoat](Dustcoat.md "wikilink") boosts the wearer's stealth stat by
  10%
- For characters which need medium armour, the [](Plate_Jacket.md) does not reduce the wearer's stealth

### Shirts

- [Dark Leather Shirt](Dark_Leather_Shirt.md "wikilink") boosts the
  wearer's stealth stat by 10%

## Experience values at level 0

100% is equal to a level gained. Level 0 is used to show the
effectiveness of certain actions.

- 240% = Caught stealing from a container but not attacked. (See tips
  for more details)
- 240% = Failed to steal items on a sleeping/playing dead character. (If
  they wake up/attack you, this usually results in no experience)
- 60% = Stealing from a container without being caught.
- 60% = Caught trying to sell stolen goods.
- 30% = Stealing an item off the floor.

## Tips

- Certain factions/squads react to stealing differently. Usually, the
  Rebel Farmers in the Barracks of Fort Simion will not become hostile
  if you steal from the containers, netting you very quick and safe
  Thievery levels. (Iron HQ is the same, however they may attack you
  depending on your race)
- You can start off with stealing items on the ground in random houses
  as to not get caught when your thievery level is low.
- Selling stolen items, most towns have different factions within it to
  sell the other items to.
- Stealing items, dropping them on the ground and stealing them again
  can be an easy, albeit repetitive way to quickly train inexperienced
  thieves, who might otherwise have difficulty stealing from containers.
- Lifted items can lose their "stolen" tag if put into a specialized
  container. You can also put stolen items into a [](Crossbow_Locker.md) or an [](Item_Furnace.md).
- If your character is enslaved, it can be an easy time to train
  thievery, by attempting escape, and also
  [Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink") because of how quickly some slavers
  will react to escaped slaves. Since slavers heal slaves after locking
  them back up, the only drawback to this method is time (and if you
  decide you want to escape for real).

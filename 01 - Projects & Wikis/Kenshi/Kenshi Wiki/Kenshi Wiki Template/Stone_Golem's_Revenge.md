**Stone Golem's Revenge** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can
trigger on the [player's base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink")
if [Seto](Seto.md "wikilink") or [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink") has been killed
or captured, as long as the player is not an ally of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) and [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) has herself not been killed or
captured.

It has an 80% chance to trigger each day if within 3,000 meters of a
[Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") owned location. This scales down
with distance until it hits 0% chance at 11,000 meters.

Once the conditions are met, the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink")
will launch an assault on the player's base. This assault will consist
of 4-6 squads. The first squad being led by [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md), joined by a [](The_Five_Invincibles.md) and possibly
[Seto](Seto.md "wikilink") or [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink") if one or the other
is still okay. The other squads will each be made up of 3-5 [](Hundred_Guardian.md), and be led by a [](The_Five_Invincibles.md). Amusingly, this can lead
to more than five members of the [](The_Five_Invincibles.md) assaulting your base.

Once the assault arrives at your outpost,
[Esata](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") will give a speech referencing
which of the two were killed or captured, and then attack the player's
characters and gates. If victorious, the assault's forces will leave the
base shortly after. If defeated, there is a 30% chance to trigger the
[Shek Revenge](Shek_Revenge.md "wikilink") event in 72-150 hours.

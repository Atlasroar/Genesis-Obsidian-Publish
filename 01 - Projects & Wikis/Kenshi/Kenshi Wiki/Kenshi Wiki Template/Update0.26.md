**Version 0.26** introduced building mechanics to the game. Players
could from that point build [structures](Buildings.md "wikilink"),
[containers](Storage.md "wikilink"), [beds](Bed.md "wikilink") and more. It
has also refined some of the features already available in the game.

__TOC__

The first building update is out! You can use building materials to
build structures in the game, anything from a small shack to a large
outpost. Inside you can build beds to rest in, various storage
containers for your extra gear, and training dummies to train up your
rookies in basic combat.

That’s just the start of course, still to come is mining, crafting,
research, farming and shop-running. I’m also going to add a system where
you can hire extra workers to help you out, and I need to start on the
faction AI a bit so that the other factions start raiding and extorting
player outposts.

Oooh so much to do, so much to do.

I also have a freelance artist working for me now, thanks to the money
from the Indiegogo campaign and a generous donation from Cross77. But
I’ll go into that in detail in my next update.

## 0.26.3

This is the first building update. Its only the start, future updates
will be adding to it.

Character names and NPCs from the indiegogo campaign are not in yet, but
the credits are done. If your name is missing from the credits, you need
to email me.

#### FEATURES

- BUILDING: Get enough building materials and you can build your own
  structures outside of towns.
- If you own a building, you can now lock the doors (using the
  right-click menu). Enemies will be forced to bash their way in.
- You can build various item storage containers indoors.
- Healing rate is halved, but is 5x faster if resting in a bed. If
  unbandaged, resting in a bed will prevent the wounds from getting
  worse.
- You can carry an unconcious character and put them in a bed to
  recover.
- You can use training dummies to improve your attack skills
- Shopkeepers refresh their inventory every 20 minutes

#### BUG FIXES

- Fixed tooltip info on weapons and armour being cut off
- Fixed timer bug, character motions are smoother now
- Re-enabled trading

#### IN THE FUTURE

- Recruitment
- Farming
- Research + upgrading
- Prospecting and mining
- Buying buildings in town
- Opening your own shop
- Opening your own clinic
- crafting
- Female characters

There is a new update available now: 0.26.4.  Its mostly bug-fixes, I’ve
disabled the faction-attacks that I’m currently working on…

## 0.26.4

#### FEATURES

- Swapped left and right mouse buttons when placing buildings.  Look out
  for that one!
- Added progress bar when using training dummy
- GUI panel that shows basic faction relations, and shows a separate
  long-term and short-term relation status.
- Some NPCs like envoys and nobles can have higher diplomatic value, so
  actions against them will make factions much more angry. Works the
  other way too, eg a faction may consider its peasants worthless so
  raiding them wont affect relations much.
- Faction relations can now be influenced positively, by healing npcs or
  putting their wounded in beds to recover.

#### BUG FIXES

- Fixed inventory window cut-off bug
- Made certain animation movement smoother
- Mouse uses windows mouse motion. If you still find it laggy, you can
  set “hardware_mouse=1” in settings.cfg
- Stability and crash fixes.

## 0.26.8

- Fixed bug where you could only talk to traders once
- Added start of Faction window (via map screen) where you can re-name
  your faction

## 0.26.9

You might have noticed some factions threatening you for money in the
last update. That was an accident, its been disabled because its not
finished yet, it will be enabled again in version 0.27

#### BUGFIXES

- Fixed player furniture sinking into the floor after many load-save
  cycles
- Stopped mouse cursor moving when rotating camera
- Fixed skills being capped at 20 for paid version of game
- Fixed npc recruitment bug
- Might have fixed the looting bug too, diddn't have a chance to test it

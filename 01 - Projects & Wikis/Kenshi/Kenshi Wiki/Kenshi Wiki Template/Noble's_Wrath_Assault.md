If the conditions are fulfilled, the event has a 50% chance to trigger
each day if the player has a base within 2,500 meters, this chance
scales down with distance until it reach a 0% chance at 9,000 meters.
The event can only trigger once per noble taken down, up to a maximum of
7 times total. The event is normally triggered by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), but if [](Lady_Kana.md) is the trigger for it, the [](Traders_Guild.md) will instead trigger the event.

Once triggered, either the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") or
[Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink") will launch an assault. This
assault will consist of 2 squads, the first being led by
[Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink"), accompanied by 10
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), 1 [](Samurai_Scout.md), 1 [](Samurai_Captain.md), 3 [](Samurai_Heavy.md), and 2 [](Samurai_Sergeant.md). The remaining squad can be one
of two variants. The first and most common one being led by a [](Samurai_Sergeant.md), accompanied by 1-3 [](Samurai_Scout.md), 10-15 [Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"),
and 8-20 [Samurai Conscripts](Samurai_Conscript.md "wikilink"). The second
being led by a [Samurai Sergeant](Samurai_Sergeant.md "wikilink"),
accompanied by 1-3 [Samurai Scouts](Samurai_Scout.md "wikilink"), 5-8
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), and 1-4 [](Samurai_Conscript.md).

Once the assault arrives, [Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink") and one of his
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink") will have a short speech about your
crimes, then the attack will begin. If you have killed one of the
nobles, and not just captured them, [Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink") will
interrupt the speech and force the attack early. If victorious, the
assault's forces should leave your base shortly after. If defeated, an
[Elite Hunter Assault](Elite_Hunter_Assault.md "wikilink") event will
trigger in 24-72 hours.

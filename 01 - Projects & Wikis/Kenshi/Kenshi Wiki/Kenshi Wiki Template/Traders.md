## Trade Cultures

Trade Cultures dictate whether some items spawn in locations as well as
whether an item or building is illegal or not. Trade Cultures are tied
to [Factions](Factions.md "wikilink"), meaning that the same building
spawned as a United Cities building can have slightly different items
than if it was spawned as part of the Holy Nation.

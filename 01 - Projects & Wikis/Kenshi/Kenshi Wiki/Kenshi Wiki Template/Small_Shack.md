![](SmallShackFinished.png "SmallShackFinished.png") A **Small Shack**
is the smallest and cheapest building players can
[construct](Construction.md "wikilink"). Small shacks require no research
in order to build. They take very little time to build and can contain
only the [Small Research Bench](Small_Research_Bench.md "wikilink") level
I, making this building a perfect starting platform for early-game
research.

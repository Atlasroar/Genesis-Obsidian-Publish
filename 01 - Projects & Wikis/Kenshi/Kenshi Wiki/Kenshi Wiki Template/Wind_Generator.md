**Wind Generator** is an energy production building that generates
[Power](Power.md "wikilink") based on the current wind speed, which can be
seen in the [Prospecting](Prospecting.md "wikilink") information screen or
by clicking on the wind generator. Wind power is tied to weather and is
not a consistent resource.

A **Wind Generator II** can produce +1 power for every 1% of wind in the
area, meaning it can generate up to a maximum of 100 power.

If upgrading a Wind Generator instead of building a Wind Generator II
from scratch, the building cost is only 8 [](Electrical_Components.md) and the [](Iron_Plate.md) are waived.

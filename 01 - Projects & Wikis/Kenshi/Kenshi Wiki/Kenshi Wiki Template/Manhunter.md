**Manhunters**are the sole members of the
[Manhunters](Manhunters.md "wikilink") faction. They roam and patrol around
[United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") territories in groups of 5-14,
hoping to capture any slave they find.

Occasionally, if there are no witnesses, they will attempt to attack and
capture freemen to pass them off as escaped slaves even if doing so is
clearly a very bad idea. In these situations, fighting back in self
defense will not incur a [Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink"), however losing may
result in some or all of your involved characters being captured as
[slaves](Slavery.md "wikilink").

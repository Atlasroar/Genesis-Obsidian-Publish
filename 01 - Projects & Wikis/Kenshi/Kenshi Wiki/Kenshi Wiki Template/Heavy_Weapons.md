![](Flint.png "Flint.png") **Heavy Weapons** weigh more than most
weapons and use a move set more centered around fight large groups of
units. Heavy weapons require brute force and deal heavy blunt
[Damage](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Damage.md "wikilink"). A heavy weapon will typically inflict more
damage than other weapons but if you lack the strength to use them you
will attack as well as block much slower. Due to their reach, as well as
their move set, heavy weapons are very useful for hitting multiple
enemies in a single swing. All heavy weapons (with the exception of the
[Bull Horn Axe](Bull_Horn_Axe.md "wikilink")) have an indoor penalty of 6.

## Weapon Skill - Heavy Weapons

The heavy weapons skill determines damage with weapons classified as
heavy weapons. The skill is defined in game as:

"Affects damage. Most normal people struggle to even lift a full-weight
heavy blade, and they require incredible strength and endurance to wield
effectively. Beginners struggled with this weapon style and face a hard
path ahead. As a result living practitioners are few and many men carry
them only for bluff and posturing. The real masters of this weapon
however, are men to be feared."

Like all weapons, attack speed with heavy weapons is determined by a
combination of having enough [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") to use it
effectively, [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"), as well as [](Melee_Attack.md). Block speed is determined by a
combination of having enough Strength to use it effectively, Dexterity,
as well as [Melee Defense](Melee_Defense.md "wikilink"). The base attack
speed is 0.765, every level in Dexterity will increase this by 0.00225,
and 0.0015 for attack. Strength comes into play in the required strength
level of the weapon, if below its required level your combat speed will
be penalized (up to -47.5% at 20 levels or more below). Strength above
the required level does not affect speed at all, beyond acting as a
buffer for injuries penalizing your strength. The strength requirement
to use a weapon is the blunt damage multiplied by 40. (Or the BASE
(Weight of the weapon at Rusted Junk quality) weight of the weapon,
whichever is the greater value.)

## Locations

Heavy Weapons are pretty rare to find on NPCs. Planks and fragment axes
are commonly used by minor Shek factions, such as the
[Berserkers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink") and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md). You can buy them at certain Weapons
Shops, mainly in the [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") or find
them in an Animal Nest or Ruin. Fragment axes can also be found in the
hands of [Broken Model 30](Broken_Model_30.md "wikilink") Skeletons.

## Trivia

- Heavy Weapons use the same move set that Hackers, and Blunt Weapons
  use. That is to say that if you have the same stats as a unit with an
  Iron Stick, and have the strength required to swing your weapon, you
  will attack at the same exact speed.
- Heavy Weapons have two attack animations. One is an attack used when
  enemies are far away from you (Looks like an overhead swing) and the
  other is an attack used when an enemy is close to you (Baseball
  looking swing).
- Heavy Weapons are one of the two Weapon types (Polearms being the
  other) that require both arms to be used. However, if you have robotic
  limbs and take off your left arm in the middle of a battle and do not
  issue any commands to that character they will continue to fight as if
  they have both arms until the battle ends. At which point they will
  only punch/use their sidearm until you put their left arm back on.

The **Skeletons**faction consists of [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink")
from the ancient times who have founded their own civilization of sorts.
They have their own city in [Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink"), known as
the [Black Desert City](Black_Desert_City.md "wikilink"). It is a city
where many skeletons retreated to hide in isolation, as most life forms
cannot survive the journey to the city. They also have a few other
outposts throughout the world with a few solitary Skeletons living in
them.

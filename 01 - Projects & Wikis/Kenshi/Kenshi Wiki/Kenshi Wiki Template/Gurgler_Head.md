The **Gurgler Head** is an item only obtainable from the unique [](King_Gurgler.md) in the [](Island_Lab.md). Taking it kills him instantly. Upon
bringing the head to police stations and attempting to collect the
bounty, the guards will not take it, but rather congratulate you and
tell you to look for a collector that would take it as a trophy.

The head is valued at 60,000, making it hard to sell. Most merchants
only carry around 25,000 Cats in their store's inventory upon the start
of a new day, forcing you to buy lots from them first. Possible ways to
trade the head is to go shopping at the
[Scraphouse](Scraphouse.md "wikilink") for [AI Cores](AI%20Core.md "wikilink")
or at [The Great Library](The_Great_Library.md "wikilink") for
[Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink").

A hidden feature of the King Gurgler head is that if you are carrying
the trophy in your inventory while in local towns, random non-party
characters will remark on a "Stench" that they smell close by resembling
rotten fish or sewage, occasionally choking as a response to the stench
as well.

## History

Like the [Fog Prince Head](Fog_Prince_Head.md "wikilink"), before this
item's own icon was designed, it made use of the icon for
[Potatoes](Potatoes.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- There is an in-game bug that causes the Gurgler Head to use the
  original icon shown above instead of the custom icon it is now suppose
  to use. The following mod, **[Fishsticks - Gurgler Limb
  Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1752014748)**,
  fixes this issue.

**Severed Limbs** are items which are created when a character loses a
limb. Characters must be of aÂ [Human](Human.md "wikilink"),
[Shek](Shek.md "wikilink"), [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink"), or
[Cannibal](Cannibal.md "wikilink")/[](Cannibal_Skav.md) race in order for a limb item to be
dropped for the corresponding limb. Severed limbs may be grabbed by

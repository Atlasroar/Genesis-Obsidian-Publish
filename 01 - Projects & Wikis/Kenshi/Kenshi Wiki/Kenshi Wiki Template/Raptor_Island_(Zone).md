**Raptor Island** is a large landmass on the Western coast of the
continent. It is slightly to the north of the [](Fog_Islands.md) and appears sandy with a small mountain
range in the center of the island.

Raptor Island is aptly named for its abundance of [](River_Raptor.md) None of the raptors are aggressive,
but they do get annoyed by standing near their nests. Occasionally, this
zone can rain acid, so it might be noteworthy to bring some
acid-resistant items when exploring this area.

In terms of natural scenery, it is also abundant in shrubbery and hosts
a few sparse trees, which is fitting for its sandy appearance.

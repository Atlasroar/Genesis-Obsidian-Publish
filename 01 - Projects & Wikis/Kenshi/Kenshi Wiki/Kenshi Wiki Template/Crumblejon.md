[Crumblejon](Crumblejon.md "wikilink") is a [](Unique_Recruits.md) found in
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"). His dialogue consists mostly of you
pestering him, with him getting annoyed and refusing to join your squad
(unless you pester him enough in which case he will join out of
frustration).

According to dialogue, especially between him and
[Luquin](Luquin.md "wikilink"), Crumblejon was a former
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink") in the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), famed as the *"White Ripper"* around
the time when Luquin was first captured. He was heavily favoured by the
nobles, who apparently found him "exotic".

Unfortunately, time has not been kind to the once-feared Samurai. After
his master died, he was left as an old Ronin, drifting the lands
unwanted and cannot sustain his conjugal duties as in his prime, he
decided to retire in Mongrel. He is now known as *"Crumblejon"* on
account of his crumbling bones, and he has become unnaturally stooped
and shrunken. However, a trip to the local
[Surgeon](Guild_Plastic_Surgeon.md "wikilink") may remedy this...

It is possible to get him to accept your request at no cost. He will
also attempt to convince female members of your squad to give him a
massage.

Crumblejon will also reveal that he has a wife, although they have been
estranged for a substantial period of time.

Crumblejon's exact age is unknown, but he claims to be at least 45 years
old. He also boasts that he had been killing Ninjas while most
characters were in their mothers' wombs.

If he dies or is already recruited a generic sword for hire will spawn.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If Slave Master Haga is killed/imprisoned then the Stone Camp will fall
into ruins.

Slave Master Haga's death/imprisonment alongside with [](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md) is necessary for
[Stoat](Stoat.md "wikilink") to fall into a malnourished state.

Slave Master Haga's death/imprisonment also contributes to the
malnourished state of [Heng](Heng.md "wikilink") which also includes the
death/imprisonment of [](Slave_Master_Grande.md) and [](Slave_Master_Ruben.md).

Slave Master Haga's death/imprisonment alongside with [](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md) while [](Emperor_Tengu.md) is alive and free will cause [](Samurai_Rogue.md) patrols ranging from 4 to 13
individuals to start spawning in [Bast](Bast.md "wikilink") and [](The_Great_Desert.md).

If Slave Master Haga, [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") and [](Lady_Kana.md) are all killed/imprisoned, Slave Traders
patrols will cease to spawn in [](The_Great_Desert.md).

**Slave Master Haga** is considered to be one of the Northern slave
Masters/Mistresses alongside with [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink"), [](Lady_Kana.md), [](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md), [](Slave_Master_Grande.md), [](Slave_Master_Wada.md) and [](Slave_Master_Ruben.md) Killing/Imprisoning any one of
them will cause [Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") patrols spawning
in [Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"). The death of all these characters
will also stop [Manhunter](Manhunter.md "wikilink") patrols in [](The_Great_Desert.md), [Heng](Heng.md "wikilink"),
[Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink"), and [The Eye](The_Eye.md "wikilink"), as

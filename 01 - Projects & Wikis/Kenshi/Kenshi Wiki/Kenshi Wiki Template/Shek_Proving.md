**Shek Proving** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 4,000 meters of
[New Kralia](New_Kralia.md "wikilink"). It has a 20% chance to trigger each
day if within 1,800 meters, this chance scales down with distance until
it reaches 0% at 4,000 meters. It cannot trigger if the player has
killed or captured the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), the
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"), [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md), or [](Flying_Bull.md). Unlike most territorial raids, it has a
very long cooldown so that normally it can only trigger once outside of
victory triggers. If the player defeats the raid, they will never get it
again unless they [Import](Main_Menu.md#Import "wikilink") their save or
play for over 10,000 days.

Once the conditions have been fulfilled, [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md) will send an assault to the player's
base. This assault will consist of 2-4 squads, each made up of 5-8
[Kral's Chosen](Kral's_Chosen_(Character).md "wikilink").
![](Shek_Proving_Range.jpg "Shek_Proving_Range.jpg") When the assault
arrives, the War Leader will give a short speech about how the player
must earn the right to live in their territory through battle, then
order the attack to begin, attacking gates and characters, and
liberating captives. If the raid is victorious, another **Shek Proving**
will be sent in 60-130 hours. In addition, if this was the second or
later visit, the assault party will also occupy the base until removed
forcibly.

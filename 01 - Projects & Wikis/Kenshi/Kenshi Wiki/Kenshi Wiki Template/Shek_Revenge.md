The **Shek Revenge** is a recurring base assault
[event](Events.md "wikilink") that occurs if you defeat the [](Enemy_Hunt.md), [](Invincible_Vengeance.md), [](Shek_Challengers_(Shek_Kingdom).md), **Shek
Revenge**, or [Stone Golem's Revenge](Stone_Golem's_Revenge.md "wikilink")
events. It also requires that you not be an ally of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

Once the conditions are met, the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink")
will launch an assault on the player's base. This assault will consist
of 5-9 squads, each made up of 3-5 [](Shek_Warrior.md) and 1-3 [](Hundred_Guardian.md), and led by an additional
[Hundred Guardian](Hundred_Guardian.md "wikilink").

Once the assault arrives, the leader will make a short speech, and then
attack the player's characters and gates. If victorious, the assault
forces will leave shortly after. If defeated, there is a 60% chance for
the [Shek Challengers](Shek_Challengers_(Shek_Kingdom).md "wikilink") event
to trigger in 72-200 hours, as long as its conditions are valid. There
is also a 40% chance to trigger another **Shek Revenge** event in 72-200
hours. If the conditions for [](Shek_Challengers_(Shek_Kingdom).md) are not valid,
then the **Shek Revenge** event will have a 60% chance instead.

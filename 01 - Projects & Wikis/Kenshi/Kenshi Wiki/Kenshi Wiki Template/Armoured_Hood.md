The **Armoured Hood** is a Medium Armour equipped in the headgear slot.
It is the only Head armour which reduces defence. There is an [](Armoured_Face_Plates.md) with no penalties on stats,
better cut efficiency, but lower coverage, along with lacking the
resistance to [acid](Weather_Effects.md#Acid_Rain "wikilink") and
[burning](Weather_Effects.md#Burning "wikilink") damage.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **3x3**.

## Appearance

**Armoured Hood** is a chain hood draped over the character's head with
a plate metal mouth-guard protecting the lower part of the face.

[File:100%Resistance.png\|An](File:100%Resistance.png%7CAn) **Armoured
Hood** and a [Dustcoat](Dustcoat.md "wikilink") are enough to achieve 100%
resistance against acid and burning damage.

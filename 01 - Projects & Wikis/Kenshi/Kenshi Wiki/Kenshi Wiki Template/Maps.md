![](Kenshi_Location_Map.jpg "Kenshi_Location_Map.jpg") **Maps** are
[items](:Category:Map_items "wikilink") in [Kenshi](Kenshi.md "wikilink")
which can be used in order to reveal unknown locations on the player's
[Map](World_of_Kenshi.md "wikilink"). After use, these items disappear from
whichever inventory they were in. Players cannot use a map item if they
already know all the [locations](:Category:Locations "wikilink") which
that map can reveal.

All maps are either obtained through purchasing them, or through looting
them from [Ancient Locations](Ancient_Locations.md "wikilink"), such as
ruins. All of the obtainable maps can be found in the lists below, or in
the [Map Items category page](:Category:Map_items "wikilink").

## Purchasable Maps

These maps can be purchased in various shops, including the [](Travel_Gear.md) shop. They unlock a number of locations on

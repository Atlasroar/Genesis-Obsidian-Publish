**Samurai Conscripts** are low-ranking foot soldiers that make up a
decent portion of the armies for the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md).

They are typically led by [](Samurai_Sergeant.md) on patrols throughout the
wastelands. Sometimes they can also spawn as guards of [](Empire_General_Storage.md) and UC barracks.

[Lord Inaba](Lord_Inaba.md "wikilink"), the noble governor of Stoat, is in
charge of organizing conscript patrols in the
[Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink") region - the patrols in question will
cease to spawn if he is killed or captured.

They sometimes spawn without Headgear.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

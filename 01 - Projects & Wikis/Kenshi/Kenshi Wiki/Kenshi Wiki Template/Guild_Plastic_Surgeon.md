The **Guild Plastic Surgeon** is typically found within Thief
watchtowers, but may occasionally stand outside. They can change your
characters appearance for free after you join the [](Shinobi_Thieves.md) by talking to the [](Thief_Boss.md).

## Tips

- It is possible to kidnap a **Guild Plastic Surgeon** (even as an ally
  of the Shinobi) to profit from their services in the comfort of a
  [player outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"). Guild
  Surgeons can still be talked to when placed in cages or when left
  roaming inside player buildings. They show no signs of wanting to
  escape provided that the outpost gate is closed.

- Mute player characters such as [Agnu](Agnu.md "wikilink"),
  [Ray](Ray.md "wikilink") or any animal player character cannot use the
  Surgeon's services as they cannot initiate dialogue.

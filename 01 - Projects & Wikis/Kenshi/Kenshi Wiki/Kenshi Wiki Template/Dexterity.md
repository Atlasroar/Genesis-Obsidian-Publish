Dexterity increases the attack speed for all attacks, block speed for
weapons, reload speed for turrets/crossbows as well as the cut damage
dealt by weapons and cut/pierce damage dealt by animals. (PLEASE NOTE
DEXTERITY HAS NO IMPACT ON MARTIAL ARTS DAMAGE, it will only impact your
attack speed). +0.00228 attack speed per level.

Dexterity XP gain is based off of the cut damage/total damage of a
weapon and is then multiplied by the [](Stronger_Opponent_Logic.md) of your attacking stats vs
the defensive stat of your enemy. If using a [Katana](Katana.md "wikilink")
of any quality, the Dexterity XP based off damage (cut/total damage)
would be 1.0 as it has no blunt damage. However, if you were to use a
Rusted Junk quality Polearm (0.1925 Cut and 0.05 blunt) the XP based off
damage would be around 0.7938x as it is 0.1925/0.2425. Weapons which
lack any cut damage at all (Jitte and Heavy Jitte) grant no XP for
Dexterity at all as 0/any value is still 0. Martial Arts is always
treated as if it has only cut damage for XP purposes and as such will
give the max 1:1 XP (Martial Arts to Dexterity XP). The lower the
quality of a weapon the more cut damage relative to blunt damage there
is so it is suggested to ALWAYS use a Rusted Junk quality weapon when
training Attack, Defense and Dexterity. (As Rusted Junk also has a -1att
and defense modifier which speeds up training. Check out [](Stronger_Opponent_Logic.md) for more details.)

Reloading crossbows and turrets will raise your Dexterity very slowly. A
Masterwork toothpick with a backpack full of bolts; shot at a slow
target like a Leviathan will train your Dexterity without having to
actually fight. (Recommended to not train Dexterity like this. It would
take weeks of game days to reach the level of Dexterity you can achieve
in a game hour of fighting with a weapon.)

Dexterity is raised per-hit in melee combat, rather than by damage.
Using a poor-quality weapon that strikes quickly (A Rusted Junk [](Foreign_Sabre.md), for example), will raise Dexterity
faster, since more hits are required to defeat an enemy. Sabres will
level Dexterity much faster than Katanas as the reduce your attack level
as opposed to increasing it.

The cap for attack speed is 1.2x, and the cap for block speed is 4.0x.

Dexterity can only be directly increased by two pieces of [](Light_Armour.md).

- [Assassin's Rags](Assassin's_Rags.md "wikilink") (1.20x)
- [Ninja Rags](Ninja_Rags.md "wikilink") (1.10x)

A number of [Robot Limbs](Robot_Limbs.md "wikilink") can also increase
dexterity, but only if they are \[High\] grade or above.

- [KLR Series Arm (left)](KLR_Series_Arm_(left).md "wikilink") (10% at
  Masterwork)
- [KLR Series Arm (right)](KLR_Series_Arm_(right).md "wikilink") (10% at
  Masterwork)
- [Skeleton Arm (left)](Skeleton_Arm_(left).md "wikilink") (25% at
  Masterwork)
- [Skeleton Arm (right)](Skeleton_Arm_(right).md "wikilink") (25% at
  Masterwork)
- [Steady Arm (left)](Steady_Arm_(left).md "wikilink") (20% at Masterwork)
- [Thief's Arm (right)](Thief's_Arm_(right).md "wikilink") (20% at
  Masterwork)

Important to note that Dexterity bonuses (And reductions) are
multipliers, so they multiply with each other. So, using 2x Skeleton
Arms will result in +55% Dexterity, while 2x KLR Arms will only grant
+21%.

In addition, characters wearing no clothing/armour and backpack will
receive a +10% to dexterity. Lanterns do not count as clothing and can
be worn without losing this bonus.

## Trivia

- **Dexterity** suffers more from damaged body parts, while **Strength**
  suffers more from malnutrition.
  - -0.6% Dexterity and -0.225% Strength for every 1% Chest/stomach
    health injured (Whichever is injured more, can reach -100% if health
    is low enough)
  - -0.6% Dexterity and -0.225% Strength for every 1% Left and right arm
    health injured (If Chest/stomach are also injured the penalty is
    lessened)
  - -0.2% Dexterity and -0.9% Strength for every 1 Hunger under 200
    (Caps at 100/300 Hunger reducing Dexterity by up to 20% and Strength
    by up to -90%)
  - -34% Strength/Dexterity for having an arm below 0 health. (Or lost)
- **Dexterity** affects texture of the character as shown
  [here](:File:Bulk_Differences.jpg "wikilink").
- As Dexterity is multiplied by the bonuses it receives from
  armour/robotics if you were to wear 2x Masterwork Skeleton Arms and
  any quality Assassins Rags you would have 1.875x Dexterity.
  - Assassins Rags used to grant 1.3x Dexterity... If this was still the
    case, we would have been able to reach 2.03125x Dexterity with this
    loadout.
  - With 2x Skeleton Arms and wearing Crab armour you will have 0.78125x
    Dexterity.

**The Fog** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 1,600 meters of a
[Fogmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") owned location. It has a 20% chance to
trigger if within 1,200 meters, this chance scales down with distance
until it hits 0% chance at 1,600 meters.

Once the conditions have been fulfilled, the [Fogmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink")
will send and assault to the player's base. This assault will consist of
2-3 squads, each made up of 18-25 [Fogmen](Fogman.md "wikilink").
![](The_Fog_Range.jpg "The_Fog_Range.jpg") Once the assault arrives the
War Leader will scream outside the gates, signaling the assault to
begin, attacking gate and characters, and kidnapping downed characters.
Any characters kidnapped will be taken to a [](Fog_Deathyard.md) or [](Deadhive_Overrun.md), or if certain [](World_States.md) have been triggered they may be taken
to certain locations previously owned by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md), or [](Western_Hive.md). Kidnapped characters will be eaten alive
by [Fog Princes](Fog_Prince.md "wikilink") not long after being imprisoned,
unless they are rescued or escape on their own first.

**Note:** As of 1.0.64, this event is currently broken and cannot
trigger without a mod fixing it, due to the faction having a "not real"
faction flag.

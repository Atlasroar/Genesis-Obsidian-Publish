The **Empire** **Samurai Armour** is a Heavy Armour that is equipped in
the Body Armour slot. It is worn by [](Samurai_Gate_Guard.md), [](Samurai_Gate_Sergeant.md), [](Samurai_Police.md), [](Police_Chief.md), [](Noble_Captain.md), [](Sanda's_Noble_Guard.md) and [](Empire_Noble_Guard_Hooded.md).

It has the same stats (except for dodge mult, that is 0.1 lower) and
model as the regular [Samurai Armour](Samurai_Armour.md "wikilink") but has
the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") emblem on the chest
additionally. It cannot be crafted or bought. Wearing one will trigger
the [Disguise](Disguise.md "wikilink") system. The faction uniform tag can
be removed by knocking out a recruitable character (Or an imprisoned one
like Agnu in Tower of Abuse or Cat in Dust Kings Tower) and equipping
the armour on the unit. When recruited the faction uniform tag will be
removed.

Stolen armour can be [dyed](Colour_Scheme.md "wikilink") resulting in a
different colour scheme than the original. In order to do so a stolen or
looted Empire Samurai Armour has to be sold to a vendor to clear it's
colour scheme. After which the blank armour can be bought/stolen back
and coloured in the usual way. Another way to clear the stolen tag is to
place the armour into an [Item Furnace](Item_Furnace.md "wikilink") or a
Crossbow Locker. [](Samurai_Gate_Sergeant.md) are a good "source" of
specialist (10% chance of MW) quality armour. For guaranteed Masterwork
quality Empire Samurai Armour you can loot *[](Sanda's_Noble_Guard.md) found in Bark.*

This armour has inventory dimensions of **4x6**.

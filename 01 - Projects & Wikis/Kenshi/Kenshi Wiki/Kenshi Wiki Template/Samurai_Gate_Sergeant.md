**Samurai Gate Sergeants** are well-equipped static sentries for the
[United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") that protect the entrances to
their towns, and lead the [](Samurai_Gate_Guard.md) stationed there. They sometimes
stop travellers to check for contraband.

It is likely that they are former [](Samurai_Sergeant.md) that earned the rank to be a
gate guard given their title and similar but slightly stronger stats.

There will always be 1 sergeant guarding the gate for major towns and
small villages of the United Cities, regardless if it is impoverished.
There is also a sergeant guarding the gate to [](Tengu's_Vault.md).

## Interaction

Occasionally a Samurai Gate Sergeant may attempt to stop the player in
order to check their bags for illegal goods, usually they can be bribed
unless the SGS has an Honorable [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").
If the Sergeant has a Dumb Personality it is possible to bribe with
smaller amount of money compared to other types. Conversely, if the
guard has a Traitorous Personality then the Sergeant will frame you if
you don't have any illegal goods.

If one of the player's characters is starving, the Sergeants will
attempt to arrest them unless the player has at least 500 cats in their
posession. It's also possible to speak your way through the gates by
choosing the right dialogue option if the guard has an Honorable
Personality.

If you reach a set negative reputation with UC, guards that don't have
Honorable or Dumb **Personality** will frame you.

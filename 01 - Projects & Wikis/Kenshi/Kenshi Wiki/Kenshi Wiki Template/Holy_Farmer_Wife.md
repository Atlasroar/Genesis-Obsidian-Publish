**Holy Farmer Wives** are residents at [](Holy_Farm.md) and assumed wives of [](Holy_Farmer.md) and [](Holy_Farm_Leader.md). Some women at the Holy Farms work
as regular farmers, rather than wives.

Unlike Holy Farmers, they seem to have no labor schedule and unlike Holy
Farm Leaders, offer no [trade goods](Trade_Goods.md "wikilink") or dialogue
options. However, Holy Farmer Wives are the only ones at Holy Farms to
spawn with any form of [backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink").

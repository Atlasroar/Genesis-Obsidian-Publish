**Temple** is a vendor found in [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). This building is primarily a source
of [lore](Lore_Books.md "wikilink"), alongside certain valuables that can
be stolen and sold for profit. Temples are one of the few places where
[Human Teeth](Human_Teeth.md "wikilink") can be found. Oddly enough, [](Book_Of_Grace.md) and [](Book_Of_Sacrifice.md) can be found in the temple,
despite them being mentioned to be illegal inside The Holy Nation.

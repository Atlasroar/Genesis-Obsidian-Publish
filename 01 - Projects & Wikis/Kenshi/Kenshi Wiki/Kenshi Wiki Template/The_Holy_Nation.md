**The Holy Nation** is a theocratic [Human](Human.md "wikilink") state that
controls a notable portion of the northwest lands of Kenshi. They are
ruled by a "[Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink")" whom they believe
to be a reincarnation of their first ruler. Their religion encompasses
all aspects of their life and is based around the dualism of the holy
creator [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink"), and the demoness of darkness,
[Narko](Narko.md "wikilink"). Holy Nation citizens are often referred to as
Okranites.

They are xenophobic and zealous people who are oppressive towards
non-human races, women, and anyone who does not agree with their
religious beliefs. They are opposed to technology, science, and loathe
skeletons. However, they can be friendly and helpful to male
[Humans](Human.md "wikilink"), often giving food or medical supplies to
those in need.

It is speculated that the Holy Nation originated from the [](Second_Empire.md), forming as a cult under the watchful
eye of their overlord. Eventually, the Second Empire cracked down on the
cult, but instead of quashing it, they only gave the survivors more
reason to hate them. Likely, the cult emigrated north to a more
hospitable land, creating the foundations of the Holy Nation, and
fueling their hatred of skeletons.

Due to the conflicts of their past, and their beliefs that
[Narko](Narko.md "wikilink") uses technology and science to tempt people to
her ways, the Holy Nation maintains strict bans on almost all technology
and research materials, while [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") and
those with [Robot Limbs](Robot_Limbs.md "wikilink") are killed on sight.
Research [Books](Book.md "wikilink") written by the
[Machinists](Machinists.md "wikilink") University are generally allowed
within Holy lands, though are in strict control by the government.

The rising tensions between Holy Nation and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) broke out into open conflicts in
recent decades. Without warning, Holy Nation forces invaded the lands of
[Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink"), burning the nobility alive, and sending
the surviving citizens to [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink"). Now the land is
a war zone raging between the two giants, crippling the United Cities
economy after the loss of this major agricultural and economic center.

The Holy Nation tends to offer its citizens the best and the worst in
terms of living conditions. As long as the citizens keep in line, do
their job, uphold the law, and comply to the national religion, life can
be fairly pleasant and productive. They are secular in nature but they
take good care of their own people, offering aid such as food and
medicine to those they find out in the waste (which are other male
Greenlander or Scorchlander of the same faith). But for those who are
not cut out for this strict, disciplined regime life, quickly becomes
intolerable. They lose their respect, honor, status - nearly everything.
The options left to them are either be exiled to The Outlands or starve
to death in the Holy lands. Although not as xenophobic toward humans as
toward non-humans, the Holy Nation is very protective of their way of
life and only tolerate those foreigners that comply and stick to the
rules.

It is heavily hinted that Holy Nation citizens are literate as there is
a dialogue line between the player character and an inquisitor where he
tells you to read a certain scripture[^1], which wouldn't make sense if
most people in Holy Nation territories were illiterate. Furthermore, why
would every citizen be required to carry [](The_Holy_Flame.md) if Holy Nation citizens weren't
literate? And as a matter of fact, the abundance of Okranite books in
Holy Nation stores is further evidence that Okranites are indeed able to
read.

In spite of living in high population concentrations, the society
remains relatively calm and content; as Okranites have been carefully
indoctrinated to be loyal, obedient and ascetic, they lack the drive to
seek change - especially technological advancement or violent changes.
Necessity for survival will naturally force them to adapt new technology
and mobilize military, but their preference is to farm, multiply, and
spread their religion in hopes of covering the world with the bask of
Okran's light.

The military of the Holy Nation is referred to as the **Holy Army**.
[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink") are perhaps its most recognizable force,
though they are often supported by lower-ranking troops like [](Holy_Sentinel.md) (which mostly serve as town or mine
guards; hence their name), [Holy Servants](Holy_Servant.md "wikilink"), and
[Holy Chosen](Holy_Chosen.md "wikilink"). [](High_Paladin.md) and
[Inquisitors](Inquisitor.md "wikilink") serve as the leadership caste, with
the latter also functioning as elite religious police.

Although the guards and soldiers of the Holy Nation are almost
exclusively male [Greenlanders](Greenlander.md "wikilink"), female humans
can still be found serving as [](Caravan_Guard.md), as well as
[Slavers](Slaver.md "wikilink") at the [Holy Mines](Holy_Mines.md "wikilink").
The absence of [Scorchlanders](Scorchlander.md "wikilink") in Holy Nation
territory is not due to any sort of discrimination, but most probably
due to Scorchlanders not getting along with rules and religions[^2].

If the player sets up an outpost in the Holy Nation territory, a squad
consisting of [High Paladins](High_Paladin.md "wikilink") and [](Holy_Servant.md) will [visit](Base_Assault.md "wikilink")
the player every week to [pray together](Prayer_Day.md "wikilink"). If the
player wants to stay in good terms with the Holy Nation, he must go pray
with the priest. Otherwise, he'll have to face the consequences of not
following Okran's Law...

associated with this faction and four different ones associated

### Player Relations

*The reasons for this faction to have a non-zero relation towards you.*

- If you start with the [Son of a
  Captain](https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Starts#Son_of_a_Captain)
  or [Holy Sword](Game_Starts.md#The_Holy_Sword "wikilink") character they
  will be hostile toward you.
- The Holy Nation [Pacifier](Pacifiers.md "wikilink") will attack any
  [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") character upon sight, but can be very
  easily beaten up.
- By turning in the [Flotsam Ninjas](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") leader
  [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") to The Holy Nation, you will gain a +80
  relation bonus with them.
- If you are allied with the [Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink")
  and/or [Flotsam Ninjas](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") officially if you
  try to talk to one of their leaders (High inquisitors and the Phoenix)
  they will attack you for being a skeleton lover.

## Locations

## Tips

- Although the Holy Nation itself is exclusively made up of
  Greenlanders, they treat Scorchlanders as their equals.
- Holy Nation guards usually don't attack your [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink")
  and [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") characters as long as they are closely
  accompanied by a human character, as the guards will assume that they
  are their servants. Unless allied with them they will attack
  [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") and character that wear replacement
  limbs, as they are mechanical and resemble Skeleton limbs.
- Holy Nation NPCs will generally ignore anyone being carried by a PC.
  You can safely transport [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") and
  Robotic-limbed characters through Holy Nation territories by having
  your non-robotic characters simply pick them up. You can also carry
  escaped slaves to safety this way if you fully equip them with weapons
  and armor, and no one witnesses you picking them up.
- Keeping a copy of "[The Holy Flame](The_Holy_Flame.md "wikilink")" (their
  sacred bible) can allow humans to pacify HN patrols, during
  interrogation. Without one there is a chance to fail some dialogue
  checks which lead to being attacked.
  - If one does not have it, swear your loyalty to Okran if the goal is
    to avoid conflict. And choose the most loyal and boot-licking
    responses for the safest measures (the ones that include bowing or
    excessive chants), since there is a rare chance that the
    interrogator in question would find something suspicious in the lack
    of devotion and attack nonetheless.
- For the same reason above, it is also recommended to keep " The Holy
  Flame" in the inventory when pacifying HN patrols questioning your
  characters when they are accompanying non-humans to prevent conflict
  or arrestments.
  - There is a very *very* rare chance that the interrogator will still
    find the presence of Holy Flame unconvincing and demand the arrest
    of the non-humans. In that case, comply, fight, or run for the
    hills.
- If you are allied with the Holy Nation, you will be allowed to wear
  their [Faction Uniform](Faction_Uniform.md "wikilink") without
  repercussions. Holy Nation patrols may also offer first aid to your
  wounded characters. Skeletons and Robotic-limbed players can also have
  access to Holy lands without being attacked, non-humans no longer
  require a human escort to travel into the city.
- Many items are [illegal](Bounty.md "wikilink") in the Holy Nation, take
  care not to bring any of them near their patrols ([](AI%20Core.md), [](Ancient_Science_Book.md), [](Cultural_Groupings_And_Evolution_Series.md),
  [Forbidden Sympathy](Forbidden_Sympathy.md "wikilink"),
  [Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink"), [](Letter_To_Moll.md), [](Moll's_Speech.md)). If you Ally with the Holy nation
  your non-human characters will not be bothered. However even when
  allied you should not try to speak to the Phoenix if you are not a
  male human or have robotic limbs.

## Trivia

- Following their low-tech philosophy, Holy Nation towns will only have
  ceiling lamps and torch posts as light fixtures, buildings interiors
  have no carpets, and training dummies and mounted crossbows that spawn
  are replaced by MkI versions. However, a Well III spawns in some
  locations (Automated version) and materials that require ancient tech
  to be fabricated (such as [Steel Bars](Steel_Bars.md "wikilink")) can be
  found in their towns. A (working) Hybrid Stone Mine can also be found
  in the north Holy Mine Ruin in Skinners Roam which is controlled by
  the Holy Nation.
- Despite being hostile to [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") and
  [Hiver](Hive.md "wikilink") races, The Holy Nation isn't diplomatically
  hostile to [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") and
  [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") factions.
- HN is the only major faction that doesn't have any [](Thieves_Guild.md) in their towns, but will still have
  [Thief Fence](Thief_Fence.md "wikilink") patrons in Bars.
- Almost all citizens within HN are exclusively
  [Greenlanders](Greenlander.md "wikilink"). There are
  [Scorchlanders](Scorchlander.md "wikilink"), however they are Mercenaries
  and Shinobi Thieves.

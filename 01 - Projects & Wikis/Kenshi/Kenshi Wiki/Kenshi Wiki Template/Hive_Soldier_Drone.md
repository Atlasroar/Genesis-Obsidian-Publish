Drones** are a [Race](Races.md "wikilink") in Kenshi. They are a subrace of
the Western [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink").

Hive Soldier Drones don't make great outpost builders because of their
many skill penalties. Their inability to wear helmets can make them a
bad choice late game, as Soldier Drones have no way to protect
themselves from the Duststorm or Gas [](Weather_Effects.md) aside from the meagre 20%
protection from [Swamp Ninja Rags](Swamp_Ninja_Rags.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- Of all Hiver breeds, the Soldier Drones have the lowest mental
  faculties.
- They rarely separate from their Hives, as they are content in
  defending them.
- As healrate is % hp healed over time, Soldier Drones heal twice as
  fast in their head when compared to their other organic parts.

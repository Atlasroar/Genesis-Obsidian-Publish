## Appearance

The Iron Hat is similar in design to the straw hat, with the exception
that is made with armour plating. A wicker head cap rests on top of the
character's head and then an iron plate covers the top of the head and
individual armour plates are fastened together to create the brim of the
hat. In real life, this design was used in Japan and was called jingasa
(陣笠, "war hat"). While the item icon appears to be black, the actual
hat is of a silver-like white tone.

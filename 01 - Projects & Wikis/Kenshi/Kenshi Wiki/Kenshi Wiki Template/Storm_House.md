A **storm house**a relatively big and cheap building players can
[construct](Construction.md "wikilink"). It is slightly more expensive than
[the Small shack](Small_Shack.md "wikilink"). The storm house requires the
research [Small House](Small_House_(Tech).md "wikilink") to build.

### Old Storm House

In some towns such as [The Hub](The_Hub.md "wikilink"), Old Storm Houses
may be available for purchase. There is little difference between them,
aside from a higher cost for the older buildings and their slightly worn
look.

### Lagoon Storm House

In the central south east, there are some instances of Storm Houses
which have external metal beams. These can be found specifically in
[Flats Lagoon](Flats_Lagoon.md "wikilink") and [](Secret_Drug_Farm.md).

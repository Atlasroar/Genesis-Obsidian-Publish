The **Fog Islands** are a collection of valleys where a perpetual low
fog looms over the ground. Scraps of massive metal of a forgotten
civilization litter the terrain, adding to the mystery of the lands. A
savage and cannibalistic strain of Hivers called
[Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") rule the land. They take advantage of the
fog to capture unsuspecting people and ritualistically devour them.

Mongrel is located within the Fog Islands, drawing brave travelers to
seek refuge in this free city which is beholden to no empire. Not even
the Fogmen could ever overrun this resilient settlement.

## Tips

- Be wary as even a high level character can be overwhelmed by Fogmen.
- If your goal is simply to make it to Mongrel rather than to train
  skills, don't fight, RUN. Even a solo adventurer can easily make it
  with a running speed in the low 20s. Any Fogmen you can't shake will
  be easily handled by the Mongrel gate guards.
- Once knocked down, Skeletons are usually left alone by the Fogmen.
  Most other "Organics" will be kidnapped and eaten.
- The Fogmen usually tear apart your limbs first. If you hurry you might
  be able to save one of your characters BEFORE he becomes a potato.

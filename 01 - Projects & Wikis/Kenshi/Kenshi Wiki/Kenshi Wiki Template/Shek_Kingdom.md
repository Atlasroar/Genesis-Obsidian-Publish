Home to the [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink"), the **Shek Kingdom** is a
[Faction](Faction.md "wikilink") headed by Queen [](Stone_Golem.md). They follow the teachings and lifestyle
of [Kral](Way_Of_The_Warrior:_The_Book_Of_Kral "wikilink"), a legendary
Shek warrior who consolidated the Shek tribes into a centralized nation
hundreds of years ago. Shek society is divided into two castes, warriors
and servants, the latter of whom are often defeated or cowardly warriors
who perform skilled or menial work.

The Shek believe that dying in battle is the most honourable way to die,
and by living the way of the warrior they can pass on to the afterlife
known as Gateway, a spiritual kingdom where all the great heroes reside.
This somewhat suicidal mindset makes for strong and fearless warriors,
but greatly decreases their population. In recent times, their numbers
have been steadily declining, a situation which Queen Esata has been
trying to reverse with help of her aide, [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink").

Mighty Shek warriors form the [](Hundred_Guardian.md) and are given honourable battle
names. The very strongest are given a place in the [](The_Five_Invincibles.md), who can currently be
found inside the Faction HQ building of [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink").

Several rogue Shek factions oppose the kingdom, such as the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md), and the
[Berserkers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink").

[Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink") is outlawed in the Shek Kingdom and
characters will be searched by the gate guards to stop its contraband to
the Shek cities.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

### History

Their kingdom is in ruins after a long war with [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). Their former king Shager wanted to
risk another battle but Esata fought him and won the throne. This is
detailed in [King Shager's Reign](King_Shager's_Reign.md "wikilink") and
[Shager's Overthrow](Shager's_Overthrow.md "wikilink").

## Relations

#### Faction Relations

#### Player Relations

*The reasons for this faction to have a non-zero relation towards you.*

- If you bring the [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") or the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) to Esata, you might be able to
  form an alliance.
- If you harm Esata or Seto, you will seriously damage your relations
  with the Shek Kingdom.

## Trivia

- Out of all non-Shek races, [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") are the
  only ones which **Shek Kingdom** does not heavily despise, likely
  because their sturdy body structure and lack of fear fits greatly
  within their concept of being a warrior.
- Shek Kingdom is the only major faction to have a tattered banner as
  their faction symbol; [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")
  and [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") banners both look
  comparitively more refined.
- Being the only major faction to have neither farms nor mines to
  support themselves, it could be inferred that their source of income
  comes from the tributes from the neighbouring [](Western_Hive.md) given their [](Tribute_Round.md) and the presence
  of Hive Trader Caravans that occasionally travel through [](Stenn_Desert.md). These tributes could then be
  exchanged with [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink") (whose
  Caravans are also present in Stenn Desert) for their goods (which
  could explain [Catun-grade](Catun_Scrapmasters.md "wikilink") weapons for
  some of their warriors).
- The number of Five Invicibles assaulting a player's outpost can on
  occasion exceed five due to random nature of the assault's
  composition. Coupled with the abundance of Hundred Guardians
  (especially during events) that can altogether exceed a hundred, it is
  possible that both categories of warriors draw their name from an old
  designation that may have once referred to actual numbers of two
  distinct fighting forces. They may have since become traditional
  **ranks** of the Shek warriors and can exceed a hundred and five
  members respectively (while maintaining the comparable ratio of
  troops). Although it's just as likely to be an oversight in
  development and game mechanics causing this kind of anomaly to happen.

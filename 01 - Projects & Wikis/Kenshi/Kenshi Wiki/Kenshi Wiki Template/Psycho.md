**Psycho** is an [Outlaw](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Outlaw.md "wikilink") being held prisoner in
[Tengu's Vault](Tengu's_Vault.md "wikilink").

He appears to be a decent martial artist and simply runs off after being
freed but can later gain a [Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") of 37000 cats. He
has a Crazy [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- In Psycho's dialogue, the reason for getting in Tengu's Vault for
  "Disembowling (race)" differs depending on what race the player
  character asks Psycho is, and would change to match the player
  character's race. This could mean either that Psycho disembowelled all
  of those races, or he is trying to intimidate the player.

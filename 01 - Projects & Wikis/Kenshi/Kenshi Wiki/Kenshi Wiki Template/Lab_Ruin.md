**Lab Ruin** is a ruined lab located in [](The_Crater.md). This location was likely destroyed
and/or looted before the player could get to it. Sometimes they still
contain loot though not the best quality. [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) have [mapped](Maps.md "wikilink") these
locations with great precision.

## Loot

All items are equally likely to spawn except for 3: [](Raw_Stone.md) is extremely likely and [](Electrical_Components.md) and a Skeleton Repair Kit
are rare.

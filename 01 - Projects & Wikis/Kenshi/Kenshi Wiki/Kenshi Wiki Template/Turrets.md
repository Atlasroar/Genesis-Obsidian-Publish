**Turrets** is a ranged weapon [stat](Statistics.md "wikilink") that
affects the character's ability to use defensive weapon turrets. The
only way to train this skill is by using turrets or training turret.

Turrets are buildings and do not require ammunition. They, like
crossbows, can deal damage to friendly units.

## Stats Affected

![](HitByArrow.jpg "HitByArrow.jpg") The level of a character's Turrets
skill improves their accuracy, rate of fire and friendly fire avoidance.

- Accuracy: this affects the character's likelihood of hitting their
  target. The default value for a character with a skill of 0 is 25% and
  will max at 125%.
- Rate of fire: this affects the amount of time it takes for a character
  to reload an arrow or harpoon on a turret. The default value for a
  skill of 0 is 25% and will max at 125%.
- Friendly fire avoidance: this will lower the chance that a character
  will shoot a friendly character while operating a turret. At level 0
  the character will have a 0% chance to avoid shooting friendlies but
  will have a 100% chance from committing friendly fire when the skill
  reaches level 50.

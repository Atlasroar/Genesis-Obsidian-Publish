**Armoury Droneguards** are members of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md). They can be found in [](Hiver-Claimed_Armoury.md) and in some locations after
they have been [overtaken](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") by the Southern
Hive.

Given the increased weapon quality these type of Droneguards have, it's
likely that the weapon they have is looted from the armoury that they
have taken over.

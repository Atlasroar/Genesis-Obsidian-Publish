**Samurai Elites** are fearsome soldiers serving in the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) armies. These Samurai can exclusively
be found guarding [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink") in the
Faction Throne in [Heft](Heft.md "wikilink") (and notably, exclusively
[Scorchlanders](Scorchlander.md "wikilink")). They have extremely high
combat stats, making them deadlier than even the [](Elite_Hunter.md).

There are in total 5 of them guarding **Emperor Tengu** under default
[Heft](Heft.md "wikilink"), or with only 3 of them if Heft is malnourished.

damage and low cut damage means that it is the worst weapon to train
Dexterity with. (Not including Jitte/Heavy Jitte which give 0 Dex for
training with) It is often found as a weapon on farmers and various
civilians.

This weapon can primarily be found in shops in [](The_Swamp.md). These are often the weapon of choice of
[Rebel Farmers](Rebel_Farmers.md "wikilink"). A [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink")
grade staff is in the hands of [](Spider_Foreman.md) in [](Spider_Factory.md).

The staff is unique among the [Polearms](Polearms.md "wikilink") for not
having a damage bonus against animals.

The ability to make this weapon can be learned by researching [](Basic_Weapon_Smithing_(Tech).md).

This weapon has inventory dimensions of **1x10**, meaning it can only be
equipped as a primary weapon.

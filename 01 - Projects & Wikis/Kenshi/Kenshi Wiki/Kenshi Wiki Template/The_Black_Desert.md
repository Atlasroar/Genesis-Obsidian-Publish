Located next to the [Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink") and [](Iron_Valleys.md), **The Black Desert** gets its name
from dark moving poison clouds and dark sand in the region. Poison
clouds will hurt your chest at a rapid rate.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink"), [](Minor_Outposts.md), or Ancient Locations in The Black
Desert. This zone does not spawn [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps.

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest.*

- [Black Desert Ninjas](Black_Desert_Ninjas.md "wikilink")

## Environment

Presumably polluted in the past, the environment is dead in the common
sense but still has aesthetic red leafed trees growing among the dead
trees.

### Weather

*This zone has the 'poison gas' season. Seasons may cause harmful
[Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") or be purely aesthetic.*

- Black desert (Gas effect)

## Tips

- Avoid walking into the gas clouds unless wearing gas protection gear.
  Characters will cough, heave, gasp, hack, wheeze, and say my lungs...
  when entering.
- Make sure you're wearing [shoes](Footwear.md "wikilink") or characters
  will complain about their feet cooking while barefooted and will ask
  you to leave the area.

Neighboring the Desert Regions to the east, **Gut** is known for its
sky-blue sands and the Iron Trees that dot the region and the large
amount of [Gutters](Gutters.md "wikilink") for which this zone might be
named after. The primary fauna are [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink"),
making this region extremely dangerous, but also highly profitable. It's
a good location to farm [Animal Skins](Animal_Skin.md "wikilink") and [](Beak_Thing_Egg.md).

## Tips

- Hashish production : Near UC towns which have high markup for hashish
  products
- Raid: Beak Thing's Eggs (possible, need more details), 4k per egg you
  can be rich in a region not just INHABITED but INFESTED with Beak
  Thing nests.
- Due to extreme amount of Beak Things it is profitable to farm them if
  one has a base and mounted crossbows, the high amount of leather, 100%
  green environment, moderate metal deposits, and being close to Heng
  allow high returns from armor manufacturing of all types.

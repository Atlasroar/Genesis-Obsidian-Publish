**Green** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink") found in
[The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"). Specifically, he can be found in a
Bar or [The Dancing Skeleton](The_Dancing_Skeleton.md "wikilink") in
[Shark](Shark.md "wikilink") or [Mud Town](Mud_Town.md "wikilink"). Players
will need to pay off his bar tab in order to recruit him, meaning he
costs 2,300 Cats.

He is an ex-smuggler who has an "Eye for shooting." His group was wiped
out by a rival gang (called [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md)) and now he spends his days as a
bar fly, racking up an excessive tab.

He always has a Smart [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink"). He has 6
unique lines of dialogue, many of which are shared by
[Miu](Miu.md "wikilink").

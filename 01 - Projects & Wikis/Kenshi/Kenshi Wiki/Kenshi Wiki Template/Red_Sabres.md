## Trivia

- Originally was called "Water Clan", seen in the
  [FCS](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md "wikilink").
- It's possible that the name "Red Sabres" is a reference to [](The_Red_Rebellion.md). Interestingly, the rogues
  mentioned in the book and the Red Sabre's both have presence in the
  [Southern Plains](South_Wetlands.md "wikilink").
- While [Swamp Ninjas](Swamp_Ninjas.md "wikilink") patrols will increase if
  the leader of the Red Sabres is down, it is not the same vice-versa.

**Moll's Speech** is a [book](Lore_Books.md "wikilink")
[item](Items.md "wikilink") which can only be found in the Flotsam HQ in
[Flotsam Village](Flotsam_Village.md "wikilink"). This item is a draft
speech written by the leader of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md), [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink").

This item itself is also considered an illegal item by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). If held in the player's inventory
during a bag search at a Holy Nation town, that character will receive a
[Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") for holding illegal goods and subsequently
attacked and/or arrested.

This item is not unique though, as Flotsam HQ can also spawn in an
[overwritten](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") version of [](Blister_Hill.md). [ru:Памятка от

The **Unholy Chest Plate**is a Heavy Armour that is equipped in the Body
Armour slot. It can be obtained at the [Bookshop](Bookshop.md "wikilink")
in [Black Scratch](Black_Scratch.md "wikilink"), rarely at a smithy in
[Shark](Shark.md "wikilink"), at a Tech Hunter shop in [](Flats_Lagoon.md) or World's End, at Shek armor shops in
[Admag](Admag.md "wikilink") and any HN town that has been taken over by
Shek, and the [Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink") armor shop.

It can be randomly equipped by [](Tech_Hunter_Gate_Guard.md).

It can be crafted in the [](Heavy_Armour_Smithy.md) after researching the
appropriate blueprint.

As it is apparent from the description, it is a direct copy of the [](Holy_Chest_Plate.md), a [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md)'s faction armour.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **4x6**.

## Appearance

The Unholy Chest Plate is made up of several sheets of metal overlapping
each other. The armour covers the entire stomach and chest but leaves
the arms from the shoulder down entirely exposed. There are metal
gauntlets that cover the character's forearms and hands. Two additional
overlapping metal leg guards hang from the waist and cover the upper
thighs of the character.

**Thralls** are indistinguishable from [](Weak_Thrall.md), thus the only way to tell them apart
is by checking their names. These Thralls are only found inside of
[Tower of Abuse](Tower_of_Abuse.md "wikilink").

They have near twice the amount of combat stats when compared to Weak
Thralls, So caution is advised since there are around 5 or more in the
Tower of Abuse.

## Lore

It is highly inferred from several sources including dialogue with
[Cat-Lon](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink") that thralls are either jury-rigged or
lobotomized skeletons. The former theory can be gathered from the
skeleton shredders within the tower of abuse and the latter can be
gleamed from Cat-Lon's speech before initiating combat.

## Trivia

While most of Skeletons possess the sturdy 200 HP body model, Thralls
are among the few models that have 120HPs. Since all of the Thralls use
the 120 HP model and [very](Skeleton_P4MkII.md "wikilink")
[few](Skeleton_MKII_Screamer.md "wikilink") other models that use the 150HP
model body, it can be assumed that the weaker, perhaps service-oriented
or creative-minded, skeleton models where enthralled en-masse by their
stronger 200HP cousins after the fall of the ancient empires.

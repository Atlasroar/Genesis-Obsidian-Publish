![](Holy_Citizen.png "Holy_Citizen.png")**Holy Citizens** are
[Greenlanders](Greenlander.md "wikilink") that live in [](Holy_Nation.md) cities, though some of them are
squatters in the [Holy Nation Outlaws](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md "wikilink").

Along with the [farmers](Holy_Farmer.md "wikilink"), they make up the free
populace of the Holy Nation, ranking above the slave castes of [](Holy_Servant.md) and [](Lower_Servant.md).

They will make surprised remarks when they see "unshackled beasts" such
as [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") members of the player's party.

There are two separate "Holy Citizen" characters:

<tabview> Holy Citizen/Female\|Female Holy Citizen/Male\|Male </tabview>

Both Holy Citizen character types have an [](NPC_Shopping_Behavior.md) of purchasing [](Rice_Bowl.md) and [Cactus Rum](Cactus_Rum.md "wikilink").

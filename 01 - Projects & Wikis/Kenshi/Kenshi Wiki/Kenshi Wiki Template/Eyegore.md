Captain-General **Eyegore** is a Hiveless [](Southern_Hive_Soldier_Drone.md) and the
[leader](Samurai_Captain.md "wikilink") of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) army. He is considered by most within
the Empire to be the final solution to any and all problems.

If the player has caused poor enough relations with the United Cities
(such as kidnapping [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink")) and has
survived their samurai raids, Eyegore and his squad of
[Samurais](Samurai.md "wikilink"), [](Samurai_Conscript.md), and [](Samurai_Scout.md) will be sent to destroy everything
they hold dear (their settlement).

If Eyegore has already been taken care of, then an [](Elite_Hunter.md) squad will form instead during the
final assault.

If knocked out, he can be handed over to [Grey](Grey.md "wikilink") or
[Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") who will comment on pitying him and talk
about attempting to get him on [their](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") side.

The player can also hand in Eyegore to [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md).

## Interactions

Eyegore will lead the [Eyegore Assault](Eyegore's_Assault.md "wikilink")
against the [player's outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- His name is likely a pun on the similar-sounding human name "Igor" and
  an offscreen incident involving the goring of someone's eyes.
- In bar conversations, he is referenced as "Captain Eyegore".
- Due to racial bonuses, he will always have over 100 Attack and
  Toughness.

![](Hound_Check_In_Range.jpg "Hound_Check_In_Range.jpg") **Hound Check
In** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can occur if the player has
an outpost within 4,500 meters of [Rot](Rot.md "wikilink"), [](Big_Grim.md) is still alive and free, and the player is
allied to the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") faction.

If the conditions are fulfilled, the event has a 20% chance to occur
each day if the player is within 3,000 meters, this chance scale down
with distance until it hits 0% at 4,500 meters.

Once triggered, the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") will send a campaign to
the player's outpost. This campaign will consist of two squads, each
made up of 6 [Hounds](Hound.md "wikilink").

Once the campaign arrives, they will give a short speech asking the
player to come speak with them. If ignored, the leader will decide you
must be busy and return again in 70-85 hours. If spoken to, the leader
will demand that you pay them "[Big Grim's](Big_Grim.md "wikilink") cut",
which is 2,000 Cats. Accepting to pay will trigger another instance of
this event in 150-175 hours. Saying you can't afford the cost will grant
one-time a short reprieve, they will return in 60-70 hours.

Refusing to pay, saying you can't afford it a second time, or ignoring
two consecutive campaigns, will result in the campaign assaulting the
base and breaking the alliance with the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink")
faction. If the assault is victorious, a [](Stone_Rat_Visit.md) event will be triggered in 95-110
hours. If the assault is defeated, it will trigger a [](Revenge_of_the_Hounds.md) event in 12-36 hours.

Like most tax Events, if the campaign is defeated by a third party
faction like bandits or wild animals on the way to the player's outpost,
it will prevent any future tax visits from the faction until the
player's next import. This is due to the long repeat limit timer, and
the fact that it doesn't consider being defeated by a third party as the
player killing them. This can be exploited by purposefully luring
hostiles to the event's forces while they en route to the player's base.

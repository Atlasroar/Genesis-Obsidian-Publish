**Suspicious Lab** is an [Ancient Lab](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink") found in
the [Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink"). What was once apparently a
research facility is now overrun by a horde of ravenous
[Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink").

[Ancient Science Books](Ancient_Science_Book.md "wikilink") can sometimes
be found here, either laying on the floor or in one of the locked
storage chests on the top level of the structure.

Funnily enough, the cannibals have laid out said [](Ancient_Science_Book.md), as well as pieces of
[Bread](Bread.md "wikilink"), [dried meat](Dried_Meat.md "wikilink"), and
other misc. goodies in a bread crumb trail leading up to their camp on
the second floor. This is likely to serve as a trap to trick players
into investigating the free loot, only to trick them with a Cannibal
ambush. On the third floor, there are several cages, as well as many
containers of loot.

**Thieves Guilds** are watchtowers of the [](Shinobi_Thieves.md). They are found in many locations.
Allying with the Shinobi Thieves gives the player access to the training
equipment and beds found inside.

These also contain fences who buy and sell goods for half-price,
regardless of what they are or how they were obtained.

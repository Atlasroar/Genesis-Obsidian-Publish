![](Oil_Refinery.jpg "Oil_Refinery.jpg") As of version 1.0.10 the [](Oil_Refinery.md) is currently not implemented in the
base game (except for three found at [Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink")). It
is however possible to access and build the [](Oil_Refinery.md) by using the in-game editor (Shift +
F12). This building can be found under the 'Mining' section of the build
menu.

Despite there currently being at least three Oil Refineries in the game,
they currently serve very little purpose. Oil Refineries can act as a
storage container for [Fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink"), holding 100 Fuel. Other
than this, they do nothing, despite their 100% efficiency.

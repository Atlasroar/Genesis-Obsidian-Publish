**Finch** is the leader of the [Machinists](Machinists.md "wikilink"). He
can be found in the Faction HQ in [World's End](World's_End.md "wikilink").
He has diplomatic status, meaning that if you attack him his faction
will become hostile towards you.

Players can talk to Finch, who will tell them that he isn't going to
share information about research artefacts which the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) have discovered. Asking him about the
history of the area results in him telling you to go talk to
[Iyo](Iyo.md "wikilink"). Finch refers to Iyo as "his assistant".

Finch is the author of many books: [](Cultural_Groupings_And_Evolution_Series.md). [](Legends_Series.md), [](Mass_Extinction_Series.md), [](The_Lost_Ancients_Series.md), [The Cannibal Plains:
De-evolution Of
Man?](The_Cannibal_Plains:_De-evolution_Of_Man? "wikilink"), [](The_Mystery_Of_Skeletech_Series.md). He
seems to find interesting topics of research that other authors later
complete. He also wrote a small note to the Tech Hunters on the
Leviathan Coast (which became part of the [](Tech_Hunter's_Notes_Series.md)).

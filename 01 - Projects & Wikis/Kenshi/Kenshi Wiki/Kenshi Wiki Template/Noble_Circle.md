The **Noble Circle** (previously known as the [](Imperial_Lords.md)) are the handpicked cabal of ruthless
nobles chosen by Emperor Tengu. Each one is equally regarded as cruel,
narcissistic, and incompetent. Each noble is followed by an [](Empire_Noble_Guard_Hooded.md) bodyguard. They can be
seen harassing peasants in cities and hinterland if one is unlucky
enough to mistakenly block their path.

For players attempting to stand up to a noble in any way, note that by
choosing any hostile or insulting dialogue options, the nobles will send
their guards after you and a bounty will be put on your head. Each noble
in the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") has diplomatic status,
and choosing to attack or kidnap a noble will land you with a high
bounty for committing terrorism in addition to a great relation penalty.

The Noble Circle is mentioned in the [](Legend_of_Luquin_Series.md). The lore books [](Letter_Of_Parting.md), [](The_Blessing_Of_Slavery.md), and [](The_Red_Rebellion.md) are written by Nobles. The
letter [Puppet](Puppet.md "wikilink") includes some opinions on Tengu's
status as Emperor.

## Trivia

- Character data for randomly named "Empire Noble"(s) exists in the
  Forgotten Construction Set, along with data for a large "Noble
  Procession" that would presumably have been led by them through
  various settlements. A
  [mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2403049985)
  has been released that adds this back into the game.

<!-- -->

- The Imperial Lords faction once included [](Samurai_Lord.md), powerful nobles who led the faction's
  Samurai patrols. A
  [mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2287038661)
  has been released that re-implements them into the game.
- A member of the Noble Circle seems to have written the [](Letter_Of_Parting.md).

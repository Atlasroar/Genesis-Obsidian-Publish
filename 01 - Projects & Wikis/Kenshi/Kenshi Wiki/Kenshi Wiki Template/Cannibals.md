The **Cannibals** (AKA the "Painted Tribe")are a group of tribal humans
native to the [Cannibal Plains](Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink"),
[Darkfinger](Darkfinger.md "wikilink") and other surrounding zones.

Cannibals will attack other factions and carry unconscious organic
members of other factions to their [camp](Cannibal_Camp.md "wikilink") or
[Village](Cannibal_Village.md "wikilink"). When the cages start to get
full, they will periodically start beating their prisoners to death and
throwing them into the cooking pits.

They will not eat [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") or animals, but they
are still hostile to them. Strangely, similar to Skeletons and
[Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink"), all Cannibals are immune to Acid.

## History

![](CannibalPatrol.jpg "CannibalPatrol.jpg") According to the
[Machinists'](Machinists.md "wikilink") book, the [The Cannibal Plains:
De-evolution Of
Man?](The_Cannibal_Plains:_De-evolution_Of_Man? "wikilink"), the
"Painted Tribe" has existed for thousands of years, and they are
suspected to actually be a [race](Cannibal_(Race).md "wikilink") of
"devolved" humans.

One theory suggests that the Cannibals are descended from inhabitants of
the northwestern [Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink"), and started
degenerating due to environmental toxins, the effects of lab
experiments, or simply severe famine.

Another theory suggests that the Cannibals existed in the same time
frame as the Ancient Lab inhabitants, with the latter being killed off
by migrating Cannibals.

The Cannibals are known to feed on one another as well, since most
outsiders avoid the Cannibal Plains.

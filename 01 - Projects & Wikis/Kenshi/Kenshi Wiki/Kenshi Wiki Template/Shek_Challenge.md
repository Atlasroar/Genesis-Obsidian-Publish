**Shek Challenge** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has killed or captured the
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"), [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md), or the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), and has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 7,000 meters of
[New Kralia](New_Kralia.md "wikilink"). It has a 10% chance to trigger each
day if within 3,000 meters, this chance scales down with distance until
it hits 0% at 7,000 meters.

When the conditions are fulfilled, [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md) will send an assault to the player's
base. This assault will consist of 4-7 squads, each made up of 5-8
[Kral's Chosen](Kral's_Chosen_(Character).md "wikilink").
![](Shek_Challenge_Range.jpg "Shek_Challenge_Range.jpg") When the
assault arrives, the War Leader will give a short speech before ordering
the attack to begin, attacking gates and characters, and liberating
captives.

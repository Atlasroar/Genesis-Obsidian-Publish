The **Swamp Ninja Mask**is a Light Armour that is equipped in the
Headgear slot.

It is equipped by [Shinobi Guards](Shinobi_Guard.md "wikilink") (randomly),
and, true to the description, it is also used by
[Shade](Shade.md "wikilink"), [](Swamp_Ninja_Chunin.md) and [](Swamp_Ninja_Genin.md).

Despite similar appearance, it is different from and should not be
confused with a [Fog Mask](Fog_Mask.md "wikilink").

This armour has inventory dimensions of 3x3.

Hivers can wear this mask.

## Appearance

It looks like a rusty gas mask with a funky long tube coming out the
mouth-area.

## Stats

## Crafting

The Blueprint can be found in [](The_Great_Library.md) in [](Black_Scratch.md). Despite being tagged as light armor
and leather, the mask needs to be crafted at a [](Heavy_Armour_Smithy.md).

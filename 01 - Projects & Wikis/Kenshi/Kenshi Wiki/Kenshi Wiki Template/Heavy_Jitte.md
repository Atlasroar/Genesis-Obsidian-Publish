**Heavy Jittes**,along with their smaller counterpart the
[Jitte](Jitte.md "wikilink"), are [Blunt weapons](Blunt_Weapons.md "wikilink")
that inflict [stun damage](Stun_damage.md "wikilink") (blunt) and extremely
minor cut damage/blood loss. As Dexterity experience gained is based off
the cut damage of a weapon, using either of the two variants will reward
no Dexterity at all. Due to their lack of any serious cut damage this
makes them somewhat useful for subduing bandit leaders and other
[bounties](Bounty.md "wikilink") without running the risk of them dying due
to wound degeneration. Please note that KO time is almost entirely based
on blood loss and cut damage received, stun damage only adds time when
hit under 0 health in a bodypart so characters knocked out with a Heavy
Jitte may get up very quickly before you can pick them up.

They are notably carried by [Samurai Police](Samurai_Police.md "wikilink").

The [Cross](Cross.md "wikilink")-version of this weapon can be found on
[General Hat-12](General_Hat-12.md "wikilink") in [](Ashland_Dome_IV.md), who used to be the Chief of the [](Second_Empire.md)'s police force.

This weapon has inventory dimensions of **1x9**, meaning it can only be
equipped as a primary weapon.

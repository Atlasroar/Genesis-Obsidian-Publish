The **Heavy Armour Smithy** is a crafting
[building](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") type introduced in patch 0.50.
This crafting station allows players to [craft](Armour_Smith.md "wikilink")
metal plate-based armour by hand.

N.B. [Armoured Rags](Armoured_Rags.md "wikilink") and [](Armoured_Rag_Skirt.md) have coloured variants that can
also be crafted at the Heavy Armour Smithy. [](Holy_Chest_Plate.md) and [](Skeleton_Mask.md), however, cannot be made without a
blueprint which is absent in the vanilla game.

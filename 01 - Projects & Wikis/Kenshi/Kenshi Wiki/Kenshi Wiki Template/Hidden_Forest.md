**Hidden Forest** is a zone dominated by sparse, rocky forests.
[Prospecting](Prospecting.md "wikilink") reveals little to no natural
resources besides some water with no fertility to the South, but high
water and fertility near the North coast, as well as in the southwestern
transition to Floodlands. The Northern Coast has large [](River_Raptor.md) packs.

It is notable for being the location of the hideout and HQ of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md).

**Outlaw Swordsmen** are members of the [](Rebel_Farmers.md).

They can be found patrolling several biomes, usually in the UC
territories: [Grey Desert](Grey_Desert.md "wikilink"),
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"), [Sinkuun](Sinkuun.md "wikilink"),
[Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink"), [](The_Great_Desert.md), and [](The_Hook.md). They will patrol these areas in groups of
1-6, tagged along by a group of [](Outlaw_Farmer.md), so long as [](Boss_Simion.md) is alive. They can also spawn in the
same number from [Raider Camps](Raider_Camp.md "wikilink") that dot Heng or
The Great Desert.

A small squad of Outlaw Farmers led by a single Outlaw Swordsman can
spawn in [Bast](Bast.md "wikilink"), Grey Desert, Heng, Sinkuun, Stormgap
Coast, and The Great Desert.

They can also be found in heavy squads roaming Bast, Grey Desert, Heng,
and Sinkuun. 1-3 may accompany the [](Outlaw_Heavy.md) patrol, led by an [](Outlaw_Swordsman_Captain.md).

With [Lord Inaba](Lord_Inaba.md "wikilink") dead, an extra heavy squad will
spawn in Bast, Heng, and Stormgap Coast.

Heavies can also be found in groups of 4-6 in Barracks in Fort Simion,
as well 0-2 serving as bodyguards for Boss Simion himself.

They will also populate the Barracks in peasant-controlled Port
North, Port South, and Slave Farm South.

A heavy squad will also help repel attacks by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) on the player base should the player
be an ally of the Rebel Farmers.

All these squads stop spawning when [](Emperor_Tengu.md) is killed, having presumably either
laying down the sword, or joining the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md).

They have a 10% chance of spawning with a bounty ranging from 300 to
1300 Cats.

**Raider Armour** is a non-armour class item that is made from cloth. It
is not in the current build of the game as of update 0.50.3 so there is
no way to get the armour other than using a modded game file. 

## Appearance

Raider Armour looks similar to hockey or football pads. According to the
in-game stats of the armour, they are made from a black cloth and cover
the upper torso of the character. Shoulder pauldrons protect the upper
arms and spikes running along the shoulders on both side jut up offering
some protection to the neck and head. An additional piece of armour
rests at the abdomen level to protect from possible blows to the
stomach.

As of 0.50.1 blueprints for Raider Armour are not implemented into the
game but available through use of the [](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md) or modded games. Despite
being cloth armour once unlocked Raider Armour is crafted at a [](Heavy_Armour_Smithy.md).

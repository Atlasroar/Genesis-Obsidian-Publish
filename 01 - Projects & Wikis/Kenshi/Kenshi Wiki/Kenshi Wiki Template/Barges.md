**Barges** are the rusted hulls of old ships that once sailed the water
masses of Kenshi, but with their evaporation eventually either sank or
ran aground. The Barges look like ships of rectangular form, with two
masts in the middle and what can be assumed to have been the bridge and
two propellers. There are three models used for vessels on different
levels of decay, named "Barge_metal_A", "B", and "C" respectively in the
files of the game.

## Location

They can primarily be found near bodies of water all around the map, in
such places as [Greenbeach](Greenbeach.md "wikilink"), [](The_Swamp.md) or [](Flats_Lagoon_(Zone).md). Many can be found in near
perfect condition, such as the one near [](Black_Scratch.md).

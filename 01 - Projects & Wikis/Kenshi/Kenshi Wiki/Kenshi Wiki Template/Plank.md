A **Plank** is a [Heavy Weapons](Heavy_Weapons.md "wikilink") class weapon.
It is one of the heaviest weapons in the game, with a massive amount of
blunt damage only dwarfed by the Heavy Jitte and Fragment Axe.

This weapon has inventory dimensions of 2x10, meaning it can only be
used as a primary weapon. Like other heavy weapons, this item will not
fit into standard inventories. It must either be equipped or carried
inside a backpack.

This weapon is primarily found in [shops](Shek_Weapon_Shop.md "wikilink")
in the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink").

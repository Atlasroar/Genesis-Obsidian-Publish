**Bandit Raid** is an [Event](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if the
player lives within 4,500 meters of the [](Tower_Of_Ninjas.md). It has a 20% chance to trigger each
day if within 3,800 meters, this chance scales down with distance until
it hits 0% at 4,500 meters. It cannot trigger if
[Dimak](Dimak.md "wikilink") has been killed or captured.

Once the conditions are fulfilled, the Black Dragon Ninjas will send an
assault to the player's base. This assault will consist of two squads,
each made up of 8-10 [](Black_Dragon_Genin.md), and led by an additional [](Black_Dragon_Genin.md).

When it arrives, the War Leader will give a short speech, then order
their forces to attack the base. Breaking down gates and attacking
characters. If the assault forces are victorious, they are supposed to
loot food and free prisoners, then leave. However this raid is bugged in
vanilla, and the forces will stay indefinitely until removed, usually
running between buildings or getting stuck in doorways.

The **United Heroes League** is a faction of self-proclaimed "[](City_Hero.md)" that operate around [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) territory[.](Greenlander.md "wikilink")
Made up of [Greenlanders](Human.md "wikilink"), they are hostile vigilantes
of the United Cities, opposed to foreigners and nonhuman races (although
not foreign humans). [Lord Mirage](Lord_Mirage.md "wikilink") and many city
heroes can be found at [Fort Mirage](Fort_Mirage.md "wikilink") in [](The_Great_Desert.md).

Patrols may follow and harass your non-human characters. If they still
follow you and you leave the city with them, they could attack.

They are a guaranteed spawn in [Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink") at
either of the bars or food stores and can easily be lured to guards in
town.

They accuse foreign races of committing rape, stealing their jobs,
making slaves, sexually harassing and assaulting women, damaging farms,
technology, businesses, etc.

They spawn in a squad composed of 1 [Hero Boss](Hero_Boss.md "wikilink")
carrying an [Unknown](Unknown_(manufacturer).md "wikilink") quality
[Nodachi](Nodachi.md "wikilink"), and a few [](City_Hero.md). The Nodachi as well as the armour they
wear can be sold in any town for some easy early game cash without fear
of getting into trouble.

[The Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink") will hire them as
expendable troops for their [Base Assault](Base_Assault.md "wikilink").

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

**Prisoner Cages** are buildings used to hold a single character.

Prisoner Cages which are not owned by the player can result in
characters being instantly [enslaved](Slavery.md "wikilink") after 'getting
in' or being 'put in' the cage, however that would require them to have
the ex-slave or escaped slave status beforehand, otherwise they would
need slavers to enslave them for them to have the status. The faction
which they are enslaved to will be changed to the faction owning the
prisoner cage (this may cause some odd instances where characters are
slaves to factions who don't practice slavery, such as the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md)).

As of version 0.61.1 Prisoner Cages can be constructed outside of
buildings. To date all Prisoner Cages built by the player are at level
15 [Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink") skill.Â 

### Imprisoning a Character

A selected player character can enter a prisoner cage by selecting the
'get in' option in the right-click-hold menu.

To imprison a character which is not the selected player character,
first pick up the target by opening the right-click-hold menu for the
target and selecting 'pick up'. Carry the target to the cage and either
place them inside it though right clicking the cage or use the
right-click-hold menu for the cage and select 'put in'. The person will
be dropped in the cage remain there until the cage is unlocked. Upon
talking to the imprisoned character your relationship with his or her
faction will drop by one.

### Freeing a Character

The fastest way for an imprisoned player character to exit a prisoner
cage is through selecting 'escape' in the character's right-click-hold
menu. This will initiate [Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink") and the
character will exit the cage as soon as they are able.

The other option to exit a prisoner cage is by first unlocking the cage
and then leaving the cage. Escaped prisoners and Escaping slaves will
likely choose this system as it allows the player to wait until an
opportune moment to exit the cage.

When unlocking the cage of a non-player character, the character will
likely escape immediately and run away from the location which they were
held in. Depending on the character's
[Personality](Personality.md "wikilink"), they may choose to remain in
their cage. Some characters, specifically [](Unique_Recruits.md), will instantly join the player
faction upon freedom from their cage.

### Losing an Imprisoned Character

It is possible to lose imprisoned characters through an unintended bug.
It seems that once the zone that contained your prisoners has not been
loaded for a while your prisoners will disappear from their cages. It is
especially true if saves have been made in zones that are not the zone
in which prisoners are kept.

There's a way to counter this bug if it occurs to you. In order to keep
your precious prisoners, it is important that you have a character that
keeps your **prisoners in sight** the entire time (even in an unloaded
zone). This somehow prevents them from being de-spawned. If you have not
loaded your location with prisoners for a while and saved while being in
other zones, you still have a way to get your captives **back** if they
have de-spawned. Simply load a save where you are in the zone with
prisoners and where you have your special character watching them.
Loading your newer save after this should bring your prisoners back in
that newer save.

NB. As it is hard to have a character have your captives in sight all
the time, it is suggested to use a
[skeleton](Skeleton_(Race).md "wikilink") for this prison guard role.

Raiders from [base assaults](Events.md "wikilink") will always attempt to
free prisoners regardless of their relation to the prisoners faction.
Even if you don't lose to the raiders, some might run off to sneakily
free the prisoners while you are distracted fighting the others. To
prevent this you could place prison cages in a locked building or a
fenced off area.

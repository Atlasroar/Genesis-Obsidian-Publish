A **Fogman** is the [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink") worker drone from the
[Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") faction.

Fogmen are deformed Hive drones. They lurk in the [](Fog_Islands.md) in large groups and are hostile towards
anyone they come across. They will kidnap nearby unconscious characters.

Fogmen can also be found in the [Tower of Fog](Tower_of_Fog.md "wikilink")
and [Deadhive Overrun](Deadhive_Overrun.md "wikilink").

They will start appearing in Hive territories if their respective queens
have died, implying the original Hivers turned.

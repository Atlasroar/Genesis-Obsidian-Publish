**Hound Reinforcements** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that will
trigger in response to the [Bandit Raid](Bandit_Raid.md "wikilink") or [](Red_Sabre_Raid.md) events, as long as the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") is allied to the
[Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink"), and [Big Grim](Big_Grim.md "wikilink") is
alive and free.

Once triggered the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") will send reinforcements
from [Rot](Rot.md "wikilink") to the player's
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"). While they will move
faster than most hostile events, they can still arrive too late if the
player's base is closer to the hostile event's spawn location than to
the origin of the reinforcements. These reinforcements will consist of
1-2 squads, each made up of 4-7 [Hounds](Hound.md "wikilink").

Once the reinforcements arrive, they will give a short speech, and then
start patrolling the player's base, attacking hostiles, defending the
player's characters, and healing wounded allies.

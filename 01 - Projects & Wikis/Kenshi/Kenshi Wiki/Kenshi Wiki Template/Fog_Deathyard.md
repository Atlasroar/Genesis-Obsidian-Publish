**Fog Deathyards** are randomly spawning camps, similar to animal
[Nests](Nest.md "wikilink"). They can spawn in the [](Fog_Islands.md). They consist of a series of [](Torch_Post.md), stakes decorated with bones, and
[Prisoner Poles](Prisoner_Pole.md "wikilink").

Humanoids knocked unconscious near enough to a Deathyard are brought to
the Prisoner Poles and worshipped by some Fogmen and eaten by others,
often at the same time. [Fog Princes](Fog_Prince.md "wikilink") are often
attracted to prisoners and can be found eating the captive.

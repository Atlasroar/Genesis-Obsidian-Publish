**Shek Police Stations** are [Watchtowers](Watchtower.md "wikilink") found
in [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") cities.

In the Police Station, players are able to turn in bounties at the
Hundred Guardian manning the desk. Dead bounties are worth only half the
reward. Bounties are then taken by the Chief to the second floor and
placed in one of the many cells, with the prisoner's weapon stored in
one of the nearby containers.

The player can skip the process of talking to the Guardian and still
obtain the reward by directly placing the bounty in one of the cages.

There are training dummies here that can be used. The residents (unless
allied) will however not approve and berate the player for doing so.

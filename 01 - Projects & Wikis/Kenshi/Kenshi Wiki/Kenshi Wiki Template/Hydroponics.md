**Hydroponics** are [Farming](Farming.md "wikilink") buildings which can be
constructed after [farming tech](Farming_Tech.md "wikilink") research in
tech level 5. Initial research into
[Hydroponics](Hydroponics_(Tech).md "wikilink") concepts costs an [](AI%20Core.md) and research into crop-specific hydroponics
require 4 [Ancient Science Books](Ancient_Science_Book.md "wikilink") each.

These buildings do not rely on [Environment](Environment.md "wikilink") for
crop yields, allowing them to be constructed in all
[zones](:Category:Zones "wikilink") as well as indoors. Unlike [](Rain_Collector.md) plants can we watered by acid
rain meaning that even in normally "DEAD" zones you can still grow crops
on the top of your buildings. Hydroponic farms can grow the following
crops: [Greenfruit](Greenfruit.md "wikilink"), [Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink"),
[Riceweed](Riceweed.md "wikilink"), and
[Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink").

- [Hydroponic Hemp](Hydroponic_Hemp.md "wikilink")
- [Hydroponic Riceweed](Hydroponic_Riceweed.md "wikilink")
- [Hydroponic Vegetables](Hydroponic_Vegetables.md "wikilink")
- [Hydroponic Wheatstraw](Hydroponic_Wheatstraw.md "wikilink")

Hydroponic farms
require [Water](Water.md "wikilink") and [Power](Power.md "wikilink") to grow.
If there is not enough power, farms can pause growth or grow at a
decreased rate.

After completing all the research, characters can build Hydroponics with
4 [Iron Plates](Iron_Plates.md "wikilink"), 2 [](Electrical_Components.md), and 10 of their related
crop.

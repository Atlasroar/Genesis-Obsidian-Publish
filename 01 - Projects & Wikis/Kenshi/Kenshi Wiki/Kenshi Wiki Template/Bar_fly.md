**Bar fly** is a character who can be found in
[Eyesocket](Eyesocket.md "wikilink") and the [](Slave_Markets.md). She is the owner of [](Unique_Recruits.md) [Ray](Ray.md "wikilink"). She is a
member of the [Empire Peasants](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md "wikilink") faction.

## Interactions

She can be found lamenting their purchase of [Ray](Ray.md "wikilink"), and
considering making goat-feed out of him due to his uselessness. Not only
does the slave have no tongue and thus cannot speak, they are also
stubborn, lazy and feisty. The player can offer 1000
[Cats](Cats.md "wikilink") to take Ray out of Bar fly's hands and gain them
as a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink").

Killing bar fly makes it impossible to recruit Ray. Recruiting Ray
lowers the player's relations with the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) by 5.

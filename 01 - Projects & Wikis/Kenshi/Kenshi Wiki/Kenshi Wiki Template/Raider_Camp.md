**Raider Camps** are randomly spawning camps. They can spawn in near
[Heft](Heft.md "wikilink").

This location spawns [Camp Beds](Camp_Bed.md "wikilink") which the player
can use for free, however since Rebel Farmers tend to be aggressive
without allying with them it is not advised to use the beds before
taking care of the threat.

## Squads

These are the standard squads which have a chance to spawn at this camp.
More information about these squads can be found in
[FCS](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md "wikilink").

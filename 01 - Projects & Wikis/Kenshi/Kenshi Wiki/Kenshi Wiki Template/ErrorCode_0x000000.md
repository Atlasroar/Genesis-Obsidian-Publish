## Trivia

- 000000 (Six Zeros) is the Hex Code for the color black.
- They appear to prioritize attacking the players faction over other
  squads.
- They have an AI_Package which contains an Unloaded Func (regulating AI
  behavior when they are unloaded, aka *not loaded*) of
  upjob_travel_target_fast, which allows the ErrorCodes to chase after
  you when far away faster than they can actually move. Humorously, even
  if all ErrorCodes in a squad are crippled or even unconscious they can
  still rush across the map (watch them by keeping your map open and
  zoomed in a bit until their blip appears) at extremely fast speeds and
  once you get close enough for the units to load in, they will just be
  there still crippled/conscious in front of you.

The **University of Machinists**is an organization of scholars who have
dedicated themselves to researching the history of the world, and
recovering lost technologies to share with others in an effort to
improve the lives of others. They put the information into
[Books](Book.md "wikilink"), which allows them to spread the knowledge
easily. They are based in the town of [](World's_End.md).

They are headed by [Finch](Finch.md "wikilink"), a brilliant [](Hive.md) scientist. His assistant, a
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") named [Iyo](Iyo.md "wikilink"), deals with
outsiders for the university, though he's pretty intelligent in his own
right. They have a close relation with the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md). As the scientists are not usually
capable of surviving the hostile world outside they rely on the Tech
Hunters to handle the dangerous tasks of collecting the artifacts and
scouring the ruins.

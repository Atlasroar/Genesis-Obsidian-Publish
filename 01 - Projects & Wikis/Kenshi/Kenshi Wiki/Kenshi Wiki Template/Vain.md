**Vain** is a zone that occupies the west coast and red acidic river of
the middle section of Kenshi. It displays incredible biodiversity and
what looks like refuge to the naive eye, but is in reality one of the
most dangerous locations to start off. It is the homeland of the
[Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink"), who will not trade with
[Hive](Hive.md "wikilink") Player Characters due to them being "Hiveless."
This location is known for being inhabited by [](Beak_Thing.md). The Hive will not help the player if
they are attempting to escape an attack from Beak Things unless you
bring them directly in front of the hive guards so that the Beak Things
will attack the hive guards.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") in Vain. This zone
does not spawn Camps.

### Minor Outposts

*These locations are typically small towns, villages, or faction bases.*

- [Hive Village](Hive_Village.md "wikilink") x5
- [Western Hive](Western_Hive_(Location).md "wikilink")

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Lost Library](Lost_Library.md "wikilink")
- [Post-Ancient Workshop](Post-Ancient_Workshop.md "wikilink")
- [Tower of Fog](Tower_of_Fog.md "wikilink")

### Nests

[*Nests*](Nest.md "wikilink")*are temporary locations which can spawn
randomly and typically belong to [Animals](Fauna.md "wikilink").*

- [Nest of Beak Things](Nest_of_Beak_Things.md "wikilink")

*These nests can potentially spawn in this zone if certain [](World_States.md) have been reached.*

- [Fog Deathyard](Fog_Deathyard.md "wikilink") (invasion) - If [](The_Queen.md) is dead.

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

- [Gorillo](Gorillo.md "wikilink")
- [Holy Nation Outlaws](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md "wikilink") ([](Escaped_Servant.md))
- [Bonedog](Bonedog.md "wikilink")
- [Garru](Garru.md "wikilink")
- [Wild Bull](Wild_Bull.md "wikilink")
- [Hive Caravan Boss](Hive_Caravan_Boss.md "wikilink") - (survival items)

*These squads can potentially spawn in this zone if certain [](World_States.md) have been reached.*

- [Southern Hive](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink") if [West Hive
  Queen](https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/The_Queen) is dead and [South
  Hive Queen](https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Queen_of_the_South) is
  alive.

## Environment

The water is acidic and the terrain in Vain has a red hue, which makes
it very ominous and "bloody". Despite this, there appears to be no
adverse side effects on non-hiver characters or farming. Vain is a very
promising location for crops like [Cotton](Cotton.md "wikilink") and
[vegetables](Vegetable_Farm.md "wikilink"), and is located right beside a
desert which can cultivate [Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink"),
[Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink"), and [Cactus](Cactus.md "wikilink"). The ground
type that can be found here is Green/Arid, on the border of the arid
neighboring desert.

[Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") are very strong and very dangerous
creatures which eat their prey alive. They are incredibly fast, and even
a character with very high [Athletics](Athletics.md "wikilink") will find
it near impossible to outrun them. Vain is host to another creature, the
[Gorillo](Gorillo.md "wikilink"), which is often seen traveling alone or in
pairs.

### Weather

*This zone has the 'Vain' season. Seasons may cause harmful [](Weather_Effects.md) or be purely aesthetic.*

- Kenshi_red_rain
- Clear nothing

## Tips

Vain is also one of the best places on the map to get copper and make
money. [Copper](Copper.md "wikilink") deposits are abundant in Vain, and
always 100% quality. Some daring players will start off by going to vain
and mining for a living, slowly making money through trade with the
Hive.

If you are interested in making cats by selling animal skins, Vain is a
good place to do it. Beak Things, Gorillos and Garru all wander the
area, and all drop a fair amount of skins and raw meats which can be
sold to Hive vendors.

Establishing towns is much better on the outskirts alongside the desert,
where iron, stone, and other crops can be exploited with the same
benefits of Vain and copper.

## Trivia

- Given that this region has an acid river flowing in the middle, and
  that several [Hive Traders](Hive_Trader.md "wikilink") sell
  [Thinfish](Thinfish.md "wikilink"), [Grand fish](Grand_Fish.md "wikilink")
  and [Dried Fish](Dried_Fish.md "wikilink"), it's possible that the river
  contains a notable amount and a variety of Fish. (though essentially
  only 2 varieties exist in Kenshi anyway)
- Intentional or not, Vain is the only zone to have Holy Nation Outlaws
  spawning with a randomized name.
- The rain isn't harmful to characters that aren't immune to acid rains,
  but the rivers and small lakes around the area are to those who aren't
  immune to acid lakes.

**High Paladins**are elite fighters that serve as squad leaders in [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) army, as well as bodyguards for
the [Lord Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink"). They can often be
found leading Holy Nation patrol groups, with
[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink") and [](Holy_Servant.md) under their command. Rarely, they can
also be found as an elite squad serving under an
[Inquisitor](Inquisitor.md "wikilink") patrolling HN heartlands.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction.

## Player Interactions

Sometimes a High Paladin will approach male human characters and give
them an item, such as a spare [Ration Pack](Ration_Pack.md "wikilink").

If you have non-human characters (such as [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink")) in
your squad, and are travelling in Holy Nation lands, you may be stopped
by a High Paladin, questioning why you have "beasts" in your party.

If the High Paladin initiates dialog with a Shek/Hiver member of your
squad, they will be given a chance to surrender themselves as slaves. If
refused, the High Paladin and his men will become hostile. If accepted,
the human members of your squad will be free to go, but the Shek/Hiver
will become slaves.

Alternatively, if the High Paladin speaks with a human member of your
squad first, a dialog option allows the human to claim the Shek/Hiver
are already slaves, which will make the High Paladin leave you alone.

It helps to have a human with a copy of [](The_Holy_Flame.md) to convince the High Paladin.

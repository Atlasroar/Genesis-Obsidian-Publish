[Machinists](Machinist.md "wikilink"). [Slavers](Slaver.md "wikilink"),
[Slaver Caravan Guards](Slaver_Caravan_Guard.md "wikilink"), and [](Slaver_Caravan_Boss.md). It can be randomly worn
by [Drifters](Drifter.md "wikilink"), [](Tech_Hunter.md), and [](Tech_Hunter_Ruins.md).

They can be crafted using the [](Leather_Armour_Crafting_Bench.md) after researching the
appropriate blueprint.

## Appearance

Traders Leathers are made out of what looks like a former leather shirt
that had been torn and then repaired. A piece of armour plate has been
made into a shoulder protector on the right arm and is held in place by
a leather belt that wraps around the body. Since the shirt is torn it
leaves part of the chest and back exposed.

  them is considered richly dressed.

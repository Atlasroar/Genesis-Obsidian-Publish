The Imperial Lords are a Samurai based
[faction](Factions_(Alpha).md "wikilink") that roams the lands, hunting and
killing hostile factions (in the Alpha version of the game). They
primarily patrol the north-western areas near
[Catun](Catun_(Alpha).md "wikilink"), [Brink](Brink_(Alpha).md "wikilink"),
[Shark](Shark_(Alpha).md "wikilink"), and
[Clownsteady](Clownsteady_(Alpha).md "wikilink"). Though meeting is often
rare, the Imperial Lords appear to engage anyone fromÂ [](The_Holy_Empire.md) that walks into their sight.

Later during development the Imperial Lords have morphed into the
[United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") faction ruled by the [](Noble_Circle.md).

## Statistics

The Imperial Lords are much fewer in numbers than The Holy Empire,
however they show clear ability to wipe out entire units of The Holy
Empire, with minimal issue or injury. Average stats within the Imperial
Lords range from 28-37. [Samurai Lords](Samurai_Lord.md "wikilink") are
leaders of the Imperial Lords' patrols.

## Help in Game-play

With the powerful stats the Imperial Lords present, they are perfect
units for using the 'join the army' method of starting a game,
especially if you start as the retired captain.

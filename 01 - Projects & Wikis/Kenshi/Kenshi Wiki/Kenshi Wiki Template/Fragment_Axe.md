A **Fragment Axe** is a [Heavy Weapon](Heavy_Weapons.md "wikilink") and as
a result it takes a long time to swing and block if you lack the
strength to properly use it. Very few men can stand up to such a mighty
weapon.

This weapon has inventory dimensions of **2x10,** meaning it can only be
used as a primary weapon. Like other heavy weapons, this item will not
fit into standard inventories. It must either be equipped or carried
inside a backpack.

[Edgewalker](Edgewalkers.md "wikilink") and above variants of the weapon
are so absurdly heavy that it is impossible for an unaugmented mortal to
wield them without penalties. Even with Robotics you require an insanely
high level of strength to use correctly.

This weapon is primarily found in [shops](Shek_Weapon_Shop.md "wikilink")
in the [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink"). A unique
[Axe](Bull_Horn_Axe.md "wikilink") is wielded by one of the Shek leaders.

A [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") quality of this weapon can be found on
[Esata the Stone Golem](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") in
[Admag](Admag.md "wikilink") or on [](Mukai_the_Mountain.md) in [Squin](Squin.md "wikilink")
after she has been killed.

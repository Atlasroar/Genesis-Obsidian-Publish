## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
The Megaraptor can have one of three qualities for their "weapon".
(Moving their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change
to another quality of the weapon) The 18 in the cut calculation is from
the minimum cut damage (13) combined with 5 piercing damage which the
Megaraptor has.

<u>**Variant 1**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.77961008 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

<u>**Variant 2**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.83928 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

<u>**Variant 3**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.89894992 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt** **=** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

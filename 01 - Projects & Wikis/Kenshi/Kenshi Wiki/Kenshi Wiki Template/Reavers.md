**Reavers** are a faction of bandit-slavers who believe that they
deserve to be in charge instead of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md). They have the same trade culture as
the [Swampers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Swampers.md "wikilink").

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

Unlike other factions who practice slavery, Reavers are unique in that
they don't use them as civilian workforce but as slave-soldiers sent to
the fray to prove their worth or perish. It's likely that many
higher-ranked Reaver slaver members were former slaves themselves, and
are attempting to bring others into their fold in the same way they have
been themselves.

Like the other factions of the southeastern region of Kenshi, they
dislike and often times come into skirmish and border raids with their
rivals [Crab Raiders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink"), [](Skeleton_Bandits.md) and [](Skin_Bandits.md). They will stop
[raiding](Blooded_Raid.md "wikilink") the [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md) if their leader is
either killed or kidnapped.

- Aligning with the Skeletons Bandits before being captured gives you a
  negative rating with this faction but they will still enslave you.

**Goat Man** is located in [](Settled_Nomad_Village.md) alongside his goat,
[Cornelius](Cornelius.md "wikilink"). He is found in the Hideout building.

He has an Honorable [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink") and will offer
to sell Cornelius to the player if he deems you worthy. His price for
Cornelius is half of what the nearby Nomad Animal Trader is offering.

**Gates** are [structures](Defensive_Structures.md "wikilink") used to
allow free passage across other static defences such as [](Defensive_Walls.md). There are four tiers available, each
requiring its own technology to unlock it and additional resources to
build. Similar to walls, during [Construction](Construction.md "wikilink")
the blue arrow should point towards the outside of [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md).

## Makeshift Gate

Makeshift Gates are the first type of gates which players can construct.
Players must research [](Makeshift_Walls_(Tech).md) in order to build.
Once [Defensive Walls](Defensive_Walls_(Tech).md "wikilink") is researched,
it can be upgraded to the next tier.

These gates are made of scrap metal sheets and have barb wire strands
across the top. Unlike gates in previous versions of Kenshi, the
Makeshift Gate has a raised platform where a cylinder shaped gate house
is located.

## Defensive Gates II

**Defensive Gates** have a metal portcullis and allows for
[Spotlights](Spotlight.md "wikilink") to be mounted on them. They are the
upgraded version of the [Makeshift Gate](Makeshift_Gate.md "wikilink") and
can be constructed after completing the [](Defensive_Walls_(Tech).md) research.

After the research is completed, previously built Makeshift Gates can be
upgraded to a Defensive Gate by clicking the "upgrade" button in the
building information pane.

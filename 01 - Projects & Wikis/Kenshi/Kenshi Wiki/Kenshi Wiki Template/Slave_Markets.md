The **Slave Markets** is a location in [](South_Wetlands.md) at which slavers sell their slaves.
It can be found by exploration or by acquiring and reading the
**[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the United Cities (Extended Territories)**.
[Slave Market Master](Slave_Market_Master.md "wikilink") is in charge of
the **Slave Markets**.

There are a few [Unique Recruits](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink") in this
location, as well as many [Slave Recruits](Slave_Recruits.md "wikilink").
The unique recruits that can spawn here are:
[Headshot](Headshot.md "wikilink"), [Ray](Ray.md "wikilink"), named [](Scarred_Adventurer.md), named [](Soldier_Drone_Swordslinger.md) and [](Wall_Man.md). The unique slave trader
[Garret](Garret.md "wikilink") can also spawn here, though he is not a
recruit. All of these characters can also spawn in
[Eyesocket](Eyesocket.md "wikilink"), except Wall Man who can also spawn in
many other locations.

Players can use the prisoner cages here to collect bounties for
characters wanted by [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink").

**Samurai Lords** were the elite leaders of 6-10 man
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink") patrols. They were members of the
[Imperial Lords](Imperial_Lords.md "wikilink") (now the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) and [](Noble_Circle.md)) and seemed to fulfil a similar role to
that of current [Samurai Captains](Samurai_Captain.md "wikilink"), albeit
with a higher level of importance.

They possessed very high stats (for the time) and sported a unique
"gold" [Colour Scheme](Colour_Scheme.md "wikilink"). If worn on a set of
[Empire Samurai Armour](Empire_Samurai_Armour.md "wikilink"), it appeared
as a golden Imperial eagle on a black background.

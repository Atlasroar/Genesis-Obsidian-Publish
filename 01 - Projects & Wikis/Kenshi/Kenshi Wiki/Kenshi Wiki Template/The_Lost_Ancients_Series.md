can also be found without the 'unique' label in [](The_Great_Library.md) in [](Black_Scratch.md).

The first book was written by the current leader of
the [Machinists](Machinists.md "wikilink"), [Finch](Finch.md "wikilink") and
the second was written by [Sabina](Sabina.md "wikilink").

The last paragraph of The Lost Ancients I cites that
[Sabina](Sabina.md "wikilink") believes the
[Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") are the dominant inhabitants of X
which is from [Mass Extinction II](Mass_Extinction_Series.md "wikilink").

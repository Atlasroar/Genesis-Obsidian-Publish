**Grog** is a [trade good](Trade_Goods.md "wikilink"). Grog has no markup
due to its rarity in any faction. Grog is made in a [](Grog_Machine.md) using
[Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink") and [Water](Water.md "wikilink") via
the [Cooking](Cooking.md "wikilink") skill. It is stored in its own unique
storage container, [Grog Barrels](Grog_Barrels.md "wikilink"). It cannot be
used as [Food](Food.md "wikilink").

In the description for [Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink"), grog is
referred to as a "rum that makes you go blind".

## Tips

- Grog is small, stacks easily, and will not be taken by Hungry Bandits
  if they attack your trade caravan. It is also simple to produce,
  requiring only unprocessed [Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink") and
  Water.
- The average cost to make a single Grog is c.825, resulting in c.330 of
  profit. (Not including Markups. If you purchase Wheatstraw from
  Slavers (-80% cost) the cost to make a single Grog is only c.165,
  resulting in c.990 of profit.)

## History

Grog and [Empty Grog Can](Empty_Grog_Can.md "wikilink") initially both had
rusty metallic icons. They have since been switched to cleaner looking
bottle icons.

## Trivia

Despite being an alcoholic drink, many Skeletons appear to have the
ability to drink Grog noted by several Grog seen in [](Skeleton_Bar.md) and [](Skinhouse_HQ.md) and other Skeleton places.

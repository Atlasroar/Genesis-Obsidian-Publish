**Return for Blood** is an event that can trigger if you refuse to pay
tribute during the [Tribute Round](Tribute_Round.md "wikilink") or [](Return_For_Tribute.md) events. It also requires
that [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink"), [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md), [Seto](Seto.md "wikilink"),
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"), and the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) to all not be killed or captured.
If even one of them has been, the raid will fail to trigger. It will
also fail to trigger if the player is allied to the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

If all the conditions are met, the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) will trigger an assault on the
player's base. This assault will consist of 1-2 squads, each made up of
5-8 [Shek Warriors](Shek_Warrior.md "wikilink") and 0-1 [](Shek_Scout.md), led by an additional [](Shek_Warrior.md).

Once the assault arrives the leader will taunt the player in a short
speech, then attack the player's base and characters. If victorious, the
assault will leave the player's base shortly after, and [](Return_For_Tribute.md) will trigger in 72-150 hours. If
the assault is defeated, [](Shek_Challengers_(Shek_Kingdom).md) will trigger in
120-180 hours.

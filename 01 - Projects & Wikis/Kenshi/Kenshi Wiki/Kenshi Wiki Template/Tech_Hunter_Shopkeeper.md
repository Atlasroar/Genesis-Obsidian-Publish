**Tech Hunter Shopkeepers** are named members of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md). They man Tech Hunter shops in various
locations. These shops include [](Adventurer_Ranger_Shop.md), [](Empire_Ranger_Shop.md), [](Tech_Hunter_Shop.md), [](Travel_and_Repairs_Shop.md), and [](Travel_Gear.md).

Unlike most shopkeepers, they have enough stats and gear to be capable
of reliably defending themselves against mid-level opponents.

**Anti-Slaver Jonin** are elite members of the
[Anti-Slavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink"). They can be found in small
numbers patrolling [Spring](Spring.md "wikilink") or other Anti-Slaver
controlled territories. They also lead attacks on the player's base
should the player earn their ire, although they do so in small numbers.

There is a HQ variant that is only found in
[Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink")'s squad.

They have a 50% chance to have a bounty from the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) ranging from c.2,000 to c.4000.

## Interactions

**Anti-Slaver Jonin** can accompany or bodyguard the player that require
a few conditions, but most require the player to be allied with the
Anti-Slavers.

If the player is responsible for killing or kidnapping
[Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink"), [](Emperor_Tengu.md), or [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink"), they
will bodyguard the player for 72 hours.

If [Lady Kana](Lady_Kana.md "wikilink"), [](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md) or [](Slave_Master_Haga.md) are not okay, they will bodyguard
the player for 72 hours.

If [Big Bo](Bo.md "wikilink") is in the squad, she will hail a squad of
Anti-Slavers who will then bodyguard the squad for 72 hours.

If the Anti-Slavers come across a KO'd squad, they will stick around and
guard them for 6 hours. Likewise, if the player is nearly KO'd, have a
damaged head, or broken arms or legs, they will guard the player for 6
hours and will additionally give them a Basic First Aid Kit or a
Skeleton Repair Kit, depending on the race of who they target first.

They will also toss a ration pack to a starving player if they see them.

## Trivia

- Due to their very high base stats and decent stat randomization
  certain races can spawn with stats past the max level achievable by
  leveling. Many of these skills can actually continue to level again
  due to how the experience curve works. This makes recruiting an
  Anti-Slaver extremely game breaking. The following races can spawn
  with "break" stats, and the max random stat they can spawn with. (Note
  not all stats over 100 can continue to level, all "combat" stats
  listed can but others will need more testing to verify. Not including
  Field Medic as it can go beyond 100 normally)
  - Scorchlander: 102 Athletics.
  - Shek: 102 Attack, 102 Toughness.
  - Hive Soldier Drone: 102 Attack, 102 Toughness.
  - Hive Worker Drone: 102 Athletics, 102 Toughness, 102 Turrets.
  - Hive Prince: 102 Athletics, 102 Toughness.
  - Skeleton: 102 Heavy Weapons, 102 Turrets.

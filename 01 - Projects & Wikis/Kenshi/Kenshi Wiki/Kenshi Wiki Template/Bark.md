**Bark** is a Town on the north-eastern coast of [](The_Great_Desert.md) region. It resembles a former port,
built around a number of natural lagoons. Its economy relies on supplies
from both [Port North](Port_North.md "wikilink") and [](Port_South.md). [Lady Sanda](Lady_Sanda.md "wikilink") lives
in and governs from a [Noble House](Noble_House.md "wikilink").

As with many other northern cities, it can be discovered by travelling
there or by acquiring and reading the **[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the
United Cities (Central Territories)**.

Somewhere close to the center of this town, a 'yard' of camp beds can be
found that are most likely slums for the homeless to sleep constructed
by the government or [peasants](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md "wikilink") themselves.

Due to the lack of Police Station presence in this town, if the player
or any other NPC gets arrested they will directly get imprisoned in the
cages of the [Slave Shop](Slave_Shop.md "wikilink") and get enslaved there.

Players should beware as it is possible to be pick-pocketed by
[Red](Red.md "wikilink"), a unique resident of Bark.

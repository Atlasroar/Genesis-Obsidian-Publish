**Yamdu** is Noble Squire Supreme under his master
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink"). He has a Fearful
[Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

If you talk to him he will give an offer to make an alliance with the
[Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink") for c.100,000. If you have an
outpost the price will be at a discount for c. 75,000. Players can also
talk to Yamdu about which war will best profit the Traders Guild.

After defeating [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink"), players can talk to
Longen. Longen will then tell Yamdu to "take good care" of the player
character. Yamdu then joins the player faction and Longen promotes
Sunida to Noble Squire Supreme.

Because Yamdu is not marked as a Unique character, Yamdu will respawn if
the player leaves [Trader's Edge](Trader's_Edge.md "wikilink") and returns.
This results in the possibility of controlling an army of Yamdus.

Yamdu does not have any special dialogue as a player character.

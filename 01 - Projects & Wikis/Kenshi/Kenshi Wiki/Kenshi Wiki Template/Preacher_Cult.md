The **Preacher Cult** is the faction of [](The_Preacher.md) and its followers living in [](Cult_Village.md) in the [](Stormgap_Coast.md). They appear to be worshipping the
"Moons", believing they will give them a good harvest by making blood
rain on their farmlands. They also exclusively use [](Moon_Cleaver.md).

Preacher Cultists attack all outsiders on sight, and will tie their
prisoners to metal poles and hack them to death, before disposing of
their bodies in a [Corpse Furnace](Corpse_Furnace.md "wikilink"). Members
of this faction do not carry medical supplies, so many of them will
slowly become crippled or die after engaging in a fight.

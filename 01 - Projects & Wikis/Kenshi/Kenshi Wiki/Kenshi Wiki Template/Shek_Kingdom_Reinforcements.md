**Shek Kingdom Reinforcements** is an Event that will trigger in
response to the [Eyegore's Assault](Eyegore's_Assault.md "wikilink"), [](Holy_Assault.md), [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Inquisitor).md), [](Noble's_Wrath.md), [](Noble's_Wrath_Assault.md), [](Retribution_of_God.md), and [](Wrath_of_God.md) events, as long as the player is allied to
the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") and [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) has not been killed by the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink").

Once triggered the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") will send
reinforcements from the location they own closest to the player's
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"). While they will move
faster than most hostile events, they can still arrive too late if the
player's base is closer to the hostile event's spawn location than to
the origin of the reinforcements. These reinforcements will consist of 1
squad, made up of 3-5 [Hundred Guardians](Hundred_Guardian.md "wikilink")
led by a [Five Invincible](The_Five_Invincibles.md "wikilink").

Once the reinforcements arrive, they will give a short speech, and then
start patrolling the player's base, attacking hostiles, defending the
player's characters, and healing wounded allies.

The great mystery of [Kenshi](Kenshi.md "wikilink") is figuring out what
happened on the [moon of Kenshi](World_of_Kenshi.md "wikilink"). Kenshi is
a tidal-locked moon with a history spanning several thousand years. Much
of it is shrouded in mystery, with legends, lies, and myths mixed in
with the historical records. This is a timeline of events we know to
have happened, sorted as close to chronological order as possible with
our limited knowledge.

**SPOILER ALERT!**

## Timeline

### The Ancients (Many Thousands of Years Ago):

- **The First Empire.**A powerful and technologically advanced
  [civilization](The_Lost_Ancients_Series.md "wikilink"), possessing
  automated factories, satellites, genetic engineering, giant robots,
  and space elevators. Unknown how long they existed, what came before
  them, how far their reach extended, or if they were even from Kenshi's
  world or not; regardless, they were advanced to the point of godlike
  levels compared to the modern times. Possible rusted remains of
  spacecraft can be found around the continent.
- **The War of Behemoths.**At some point, a war broke out between the
  First Empire and an unknown enemy. The war was very destructive and
  used weapons so powerful that their owners began to fear the
  consequences of using them, such as the Behemoths, giant Skeletons
  that tower over the normal races.
- **Obedience.**Due to their fear of the Behemoths, the Ancients decided
  to dispose of them. Taking advantage of their unquestioning loyalty,
  the Ancients ordered the Behemoths down into a [](Obedience.md) and then betrayed their servants by
  encasing the pit in solid metal. (Possibly included the ordering of
  suicide among normal skeletons, as there are apparently many cases of
  skeleton bodies found with suicide as the cause of death. Unconfirmed
  if related.)
- **The Chaos Age.**A time of many calamities, from dangerous celestial
  activity, to natural disasters, to plagues, to a skeleton rebellion
  (possibly in vengeance for Obedience). It's unclear exactly what
  happened, but it brought the great empire of the Ancients to its
  knees, and humanity to the brink of extinction. According to ancient
  legends, the calamities were stopped by a being named Chitrin, though
  the validity of these legends is impossible to say.

### Second Empire (1000+ Years Ago)

- **The Second Empire is Founded.**Many hundreds or thousands of years
  after the Chaos Age, to redeem themselves in the eyes of humanity for
  their actions of the past (though the humans had long since
  forgotten), [Cat-Lon](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink") and his Skeleton
  followers founded an [empire](Second_Empire.md "wikilink"). They
  attempted to rebuild civilization and study the remains of the Ancient
  Empire.
- **The Northwesterners Turn to Cannibalism.**At some point, and for
  reasons unknown, the [humans in the northwest](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink")
  developed a taste for human flesh. Cat-Lon's empire spent a fair
  amount of resources combating them, including the formation of a
  militant group known as the [](Hydraulic_Knight.md). These knights would combat the
  external enemies of the empire, such as pirates and cannibals. The
  cannibal tribes have legends that speak of a skeleton warrior they
  know as "The Inedible One." It is highly likely that this warrior was
  a member of the Hydraulic Knights, possibly their leader [](General_Jang.md).
- **The Empire starts to Crumble.**While initially founded with good
  intentions, to keep the peace, the empire became more and more
  dictatorial. [Child prisons](Rhinobot.md "wikilink"), crackdowns on
  piracy and religious cults, and the killing of many of their own
  innocent citizens in the process much-inflamed tensions amongst the
  populace. When a great famine hit, the empire neared its breaking
  point.
- **The Founding of the Holy Nation.**While details from this time are
  sparse (and rarely trustworthy), legends say it was around this time
  that a great leader of humanity stepped forward and gathered his
  followers in rebellion. Legends call him the Phoenix, champion of the
  god Okran and possessor of the everlasting Holy Flame. He liberated
  the imprisoned humans, and eventually went on to found one of the
  oldest living civilizations to this day, [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md).
- **The Fall of the Second Empire.**It is unclear what actually caused
  the fall of the empire. The most reliable evidence would suggest
  betrayals from the inside, possibly combined with the rebellion of the
  Okranites. Regardless, the empire collapsed. Their leaders retreated
  into the dangerous [Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink"), where they reside
  to this day. The rest of the empire fell into ruins, though some
  settlements like the [Black Desert City](Black_Desert_City.md "wikilink")
  survived, and many likely became the towns the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) reside in to this day.

### Intermediate Period (100-1000 Years Ago)

- **Appearance of the Hivers.**Though it is unclear when or how the
  [Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink") appeared, it is evident they were not around
  much, if at all, at the time of Cat-Lon's empire at least not in a
  form recognizable as a Hiver. Whether they mutated from humans or came
  from a land across the seas, they appeared and have been a resident of
  our lands ever since.
- **Appearance of the** **Modern Shek.**While it is likely the
  [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") existed during Cat-Lon's empire, and possibly
  even back to the days of Ancients, they did not have the appearance
  they currently sport. Their previous appearance was much more similar
  to a standard human, as they lacked the horns they are known for, and
  were known as Enforcers. It is unknown what role they played in the
  empires of old, though given the name it is possible they were a
  soldier caste, dedicated to fighting their master's enemies. This
  could explain the Okranite belief of them being "Servants of Darkness"
  if they fought on opposite sides during the human rebellion against
  the Second Empire... The truth, however, has been lost to time.
- **The Rise and Fall of Kral.**For as long as anyone can remember, the
  Shek were simple tribes living in the wilderness, divided and warring
  regularly. At one point, a great Shek warrior named
  [Kral](Way_Of_The_Warrior:_The_Book_Of_Kral "wikilink") unified the
  tribes into a powerful kingdom, taught his followers a code of honor
  and strength, and led them into a march of conquest. Eventually,
  however, he was [slain](Kral's_Last_Stand.md "wikilink") in battle
  against an enemy force that legends say outnumbered him a hundredfold.
  After his death, he attained near godlike levels of worship from his
  followers, who want nothing more than to die in a great battle like
  him. As such, they have continued their raiding and warlike ways with
  their neighbours ever since.
- **The Birth of the United Cities and the Traders Guild.**It is implied
  that the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") and [](Traders_Guild.md) were formed in the ashes of a former
  empire. Whether this was the Second Empire itself or another one is
  unknown, but the United Cities and the Traders Guild seized power and
  began to institute new laws regarding slavery, where people would be
  free of the tyranny of the former empire, and only the criminals would
  be relegated forcefully to the mines and farms. However, much like the
  Second Empire in the past, the term of 'criminal' was found to be more
  and more loosely applied.

### Recent History (0-100 Years Ago)

- **As is Holy Nation tradition, the 62nd Phoenix** was taken from his
  birth parents shortly after his birth and raised in isolation by the
  High Priest. There he was indoctrinated into the Okranite religion and
  taught all the skills he needed in order to rule the empire. The 62nd
  Phoenix is said to be one of the most hegemonistic Phoenixes in the
  Holy Nation's history, having judged his own family at the age of 16,
  sentencing them to be purged in Holy Fire. Ever since, Holy Lord
  Phoenix has championed the unrelenting will of
  [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink").
- **The Red Rebellion and the rise of the tyrannical Emperor Tengu.**A
  few decades ago, the southern plains suffered a significant drought,
  which in turn caused a severe famine that nearly brought the United
  Cities to its collective knees. Due to the famine, the southern cities
  were forced to rely on the Traders' Guild to bring them the supplies
  they needed to survive. Unfortunately, bandits and Shek raiders
  blockaded the routes and took these supplies for themselves. What
  little did get through was instantly set upon by the nobles in a
  bidding war, and the lower classes were driven to starvation and
  [rebellion](The_Red_Rebellion.md "wikilink"). The resultant fighting
  claimed many lives, including many nobles and even [](Puppet.md) himself, but the rebels were eventually put
  down and survivors enslaved. This marked the selection of a new
  Emperor from the [Noble's Circle](Noble_Circle.md "wikilink"), [](Emperor_Tengu.md), a cruel and impulsive man known for
  his lack of common sense. As a result, the poor and downtrodden are
  now even more heavily oppressed, even being arrested and sold into
  slavery for merely being poor as they are seen as a threat to the
  stability of the empire itself.
- **The Holy Nation's war on the United Cities and the destruction of
  Bast.**[Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink") was once a prosperous and
  fertile area, filled with many farmlands and towns for trading.
  However, everything changed when the Holy Nation attacked, who
  proceeded to burn towns and farms to the ground and haul the children
  off to [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink"). It is unclear what exactly
  compelled this radical change that shattered the long peace, but it is
  likely that more or less it has to do with the tyranny of Tengu and/or
  paranoia of UC elites having wild ambition to take over the grass
  lands and enslave the civilians. Either way, the land has been a
  warzone where both the Holy Nation and United cities vie endlessly in
  a stalemate, trampling underfoot any life that may have once thrived
  here.
- **Revenge of Luquin.**[Luquin](Luquin.md "wikilink") and his family were
  sold into slavery at a young age, where they were subjected to
  beatings, starvation, and exhaustion from working in the mines.
  Eventually, his father would succumb to the horrid conditions,
  devastating both Luquin and his mother, who, with nothing left to
  lose, devised an escape plan to save her son. She succeeded in freeing
  him, but at the cost of her own life. Starving and alone in the desert
  at the age of 15, he was found and taken in by a clan of ninjas who
  trained him in the arts of stealth and assassination. Seven years
  later, he returned to his hometown for blood, using his skills to
  stalk and assassinate noble after noble. Eventually, Luquin was
  arrested and paraded through the streets as a criminal before being
  sent off to [Tengu's Vault](Tengu's_Vault.md "wikilink"), where he was
  subjected to many tortures, including being forced to write a
  [book](Beautiful_Tengu:_A_Tribute "wikilink") in tribute to Emperor
  Tengu.
- **Overthrow of King Shager.**[Shager](King_Shager's_Reign.md "wikilink")
  was the latest in the line of Kings from the Shek Kingdom. Like most
  Shek, he saw battle as a point of honor, with death in battle being
  the highest of honors. Under his rule, the Shek Kingdom was crumbling
  under the loss of life sustained in their wars with the Holy nation
  and the United Cities. King Shager proposed a desperate, suicidal last
  stand with whatever weakened warriors were left. To this, the warrior
  [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink") spoke up, protesting against throwing away
  their lives needlessly. Shager was furious, but one of the [](The_Five_Invincibles.md), [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md), stepped between the two and
  shouted, "the man speaks the truth. You want Bayan silenced; you'll
  have to cut me down first". Their swords crossed, and that day [](Shager's_Overthrow.md) of the Stone Golem's
  rule, with Bayan at her side. She pulled her warriors off the front
  lines, made peace with the United Cities, and opened her borders to
  trade from the other races. Despite protests from some of her
  warriors, she is determined to ensure her people survive into the
  future, even if it means tearing down some of their long-held ideals
  and traditions.

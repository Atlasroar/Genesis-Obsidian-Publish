**Anti-Slaver Reinforcements** is an [Event](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Events.md "wikilink") that
will trigger in response to the [](Eyegore's_Assault.md), [](Noble's_Wrath.md), and [](Noble's_Wrath_Assault.md) events triggering, as long as
the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") is allied to the
[Anti-Slavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") faction, and as long as
[Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") and [Jaegar](Jaegar.md "wikilink") are still
alive and free.

Once triggered, the [Anti-Slavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") will send
reinforcements from [Spring](Spring.md "wikilink"). While they will move
faster than most hostile events, they can still arrive too late if the
player's [Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") is closer to
the hostile event's spawn location than to [Spring](Spring.md "wikilink").
These reinforcements will consist of 2 squads, each made up of 4
[Anti-Slaver Jonin](Anti-Slaver_Jonin.md "wikilink"), and will be led by
[Jaegar](Jaegar.md "wikilink").

Once the reinforcements arrive, they will give a short speech, and then
start patrolling the player's base, attacking hostiles, defending the
player's characters, and healing wounded allies.

## Combat Speed

Combat Speed is how fast your character can fight in combat and swing in
combat so your character can get moves in quicker before their enemies
can. It is determined by a combination of your
[Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"), and
[Attack](Melee_Attack.md "wikilink")/[Defense](Melee_Defense.md "wikilink")/[](Martial_Arts.md) [Statistics](Statistics.md "wikilink"),
while also being heavily affected by the [Weapon](Weapons.md "wikilink")
you choose to wield and the [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") level
required to use it. Some [Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") and
[Clothing](Clothing.md "wikilink") types provide modifiers to it, making
your character swing and block faster or slower depending on their gear.

Training your Dexterity and Attack/Defense skills are generally the
primary method of increasing your Combat Speed, but maintaining a decent
level of strength relative to your weapon is essential as well. The
generally accepted rule is to maintain a Strength level of more than
double the weight of your weapon in order to use the weapon effectively.

Oddly enough, Dodge is completely unaffected by Combat Speed. The
movements seem to take the same amount of time regardless. Similarly
odd, if they were affected, they appear to be set to look at the
[Martial Arts](Martial_Arts.md "wikilink") skill instead of
[Dodge](Dodge.md "wikilink") as their other speed enhancing skill besides
Dexterity.

### Details

The total value is based on a combination of your attack skill ([](Melee_Attack.md) or [](Martial_Arts.md)) or defense skill ([](Melee_Defense.md)), depending on whether you're
attacking or defending, and your [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink").
Roughly speaking, Dexterity will have a 1.5x greater effect on speed
than the other skill in the pair will.

All weapons have a required Strength level to wield effectively,
determined by the Blunt Damage of the weapon. In most cases this equals
out to x2 the weight of the weapon (it is technically the Blunt Damage
of the weapon multiplied by 40, but this will equal the same number as
weight x2 in the majority of cases). If one does not have the required
Strength to wield a weapon, this will result in a penalty to the speed.
This scales as far as around -50% at 20 levels or lower than the
required level. For every level above the 20 levels mark, the penalty
will decrease by about 2.5% until you reach the required level.

Contrary to what has long been believed, damage types appear to have no
direct affect on speed, or what skills are taken into consideration. As
mentioned above, Blunt Damage affects the required Strength level of a
weapon, meaning that in some cases Strength can be seen increasing the
speed of a weapon, but in truth it is simply reducing the penalties
instead. Assuming you have enough Strength to wield the weapon, extra
Strength will have no affect on speed.

## Combat Move Speed

Combat Move Speed is how fast your character moves around while in
combat. It is often confused with the Combat Speed above, but is a
distinctly separate and independent value. It is often modified by your
[Race](Races.md "wikilink"), providing bonuses or penalties depending on
which one your character is.

There is currently no know way to increase Combat Move Speed, beyond
race selection. Though it is not impossible there is one that simply
hasn't been discovered.

Hive Prince/Worker - 1.2

Hive Soldier Drone - 1.1

Greenlander/Scorchlander - 1

Shek - 1

Skeleton - 0.9

NOTE: This list covers playable races in Kenshi. Combat Move Speed for
all races can be discovered in the [](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md).

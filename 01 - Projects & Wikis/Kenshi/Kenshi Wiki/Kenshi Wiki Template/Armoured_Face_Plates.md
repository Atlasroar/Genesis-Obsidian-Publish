The **Armoured Face Plates** is a Medium Armour that is equipped in the
Headgear slot. There is a [hooded variant](Armoured_Hood.md "wikilink")
with higher coverage and resistance to
[acid](Weather_Effects.md#Acid_Rain "wikilink") and
[burning](Weather_Effects.md#Burning "wikilink") damage, but with penalties
on combat stats and less protection from cutting damage (due to lower
cut resistance efficiency).

This armour has inventory dimensions of **3x3**.

## Appearance

The Armoured Face Plates look like metal plates moulded on top of each
other in a wedge shape to cover neck and chin. It does not reach higher
than the nose.

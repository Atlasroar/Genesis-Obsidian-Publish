![](Ancient_Labs.png "Ancient_Labs.png") **Ancient Labs** are the
remnants of a time long past. Once a functional part of advanced
civilizations, they now lay in shambles. Treasure seekers should be
wary, as the ruins have not gone altogether silent. The mechanical
sentries of the past still roam the rubble, and those who wish to
salvage the lost tech from these labs must face down many [](Security_Spider.md). [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) have scouted these locations and
[mapped](Maps.md "wikilink") them for brave treasure seekers.

## Locations

Currently in the world, there are fourteen Ancient Labs.

### Burning Forest Lab

There is an Ancient Lab in the [](Burning_Forest.md). It is occupied by the Security
Spiders and therefore still contains loot from ancient times.

### The Crater Labs

Inside of [The Crater](The_Crater.md "wikilink"), there are many [](Empty_Lab.md) and one Ancient Lab to the north.

### Crumbling Labs

In [Stobe's Gamble](Stobe's_Gamble.md "wikilink") east of
[Spring](Spring.md "wikilink"), there is [](Crumbling_Labs.md) inside of an acid lake. This location
has two Ancient Labs buildings, but one is ruined and contains [](King_Gorillo.md). The other Ancient Lab will likely
contain many Security Spiders.

### The Floodland Lab

In the center of the [Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink"), there is an
Ancient Lab. Security Spiders control this lab.

### The Forbidden Lab

Far to the east of the [Stormgap Coast](Stormgap_Coast.md "wikilink") and
in the northernmost corner of the [](Forbidden_Isle.md), there is an Ancient Lab.

### The Infested Lab

The [Infested Lab](Infested_Lab.md "wikilink"), is a lab in the
southeastern part of [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink").

### The Iron Lab

This [Ancient Tech Lab](Ancient_Tech_Lab.md "wikilink") is on the
westernmost section of [The Iron Trail](The_Iron_Trail.md "wikilink").
After passing numerous [Iron Spiders](Iron_Spider.md "wikilink") to reach
the lab, it will likely be inhabited by six [](Security_Spider.md) and a singular [](Broken_Skeleton.md).

### Island Lab

The [Island Lab](Island_Lab.md "wikilink") is an Ancient Lab located on the
southwest tip of [Fishman Island](Fishman_Island.md "wikilink"). It is the
home of many [Fishmen](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink") as well as their leader,
[King Gurgler](King_Gurgler.md "wikilink").

### Narko's Trap

This [Ancient Tech Lab](Ancient_Tech_Lab.md "wikilink") can be found in the
eastern edge of [The Holy Nation](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")'s
territory. The Holy Nation is keeping [](Narko's_Trap.md) under heavy guard so that no one can
"sin" by studying the technology inside. Two [](Security_Spider.md) are inside of the lab itself.

### Obedience

There is an Ancient Lab in [Obedience](Obedience.md "wikilink"). It
possibly contains no [AI Cores](AI%20Core.md "wikilink").

### Tower of Abuse

[Tower of Abuse](Tower_of_Abuse.md "wikilink") is a location in
[Venge](Venge.md "wikilink"). This [](Ancient_Tech_Lab.md) is the home of the leaders of the
[Thrall Masters](Thrall_Masters.md "wikilink") and their prisoner
[Agnu](Agnu.md "wikilink").

### The Shun Lab

In the center of the northwestern peninsula of the region of
[Shun](Shun.md "wikilink"), there is an [](Ancient_Tech_Lab.md). This lab will likely contain many
[Security Spiders](Security_Spider.md "wikilink").

### Suspicious Lab

The [Suspicious Lab](Suspicious_Lab.md "wikilink") is an Ancient Lab which
was overrun by [Cannibals](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink"). The Cannibals are much
easier to sneak past than Security Spiders are, however, this Lab does
not contain an [AI Core](AI%20Core.md "wikilink"). Only [](Ancient_Science_Book.md) can be found on the floor of the
Lab and inside the boxes upstairs.

### Swamped Lab

The [Swamped Lab](Swamped_Lab.md "wikilink") is an Ancient Lab which was
lost to [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"). It contains many [](Blood_Spider.md) inside which swarm outside when the
gate is unlocked.

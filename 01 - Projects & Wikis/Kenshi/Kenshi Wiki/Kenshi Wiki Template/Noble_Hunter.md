**Noble Hunters** are unnamed [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink")
nobles with [Diplomatic Status](Diplomatic_Status.md "wikilink"). They can
be found patrolling with a [Noble Captain](Noble_Captain.md "wikilink") and
six [Hooded Empire Noble Guards](Empire_Noble_Guard_Hooded.md "wikilink"),
along with a number of slaves.

This character can spawn in [Stormgap Coast](Stormgap_Coast.md "wikilink"),
[The Great Desert](The_Great_Desert.md "wikilink"), and [](The_Hook.md), as long as [](Emperor_Tengu.md) has not been killed or imprisoned.

While Noble Hunters tend to hunt purely for sport, they seem to hold
[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") as high value trophies, prompting
unique dialogue when they fire on one.

Note that the slaves accompanying them will attack you should you decide
to retaliate. Defeating the [Noble](Noble_Circle.md "wikilink") and their
guards before knocking down the slaves may result in them escaping or
joining you.

## Trivia

- These manhunters seem to decapitate their prize and mount their heads
  akin to animals. They start dialogue that implies this if their target
  is a female.

  by the Skeleton Smiths or the Edgewalkers. In-game, however, crossbow
  grades are determined similar to armour grades instead of like weapons
  with manufacturers.
- The conditions for being attacked by a Noble Hunter, taken from the
  FCS, are as follows:
  - Target is not in combat, Noble Hunter is not in combat, Target is
    not imprisoned, Noble Hunter is not imprisoned, Noble Hunter is
    leader of his squad, Noble Hunter is not nearly KO'd, Noble Hunter
    is not outnumbered, Target is not unconcious, Noble Hunter is not a
    slave, Noble Hunter does not have broken arms, Noble Hunter's squad
    is not downed, Noble Hunter does not have broken legs, Noble Hunter

**Sniperbots **are members of the [](Old_Machines.md) which can be found patrolling in the
southeast. Specifically, they can spawn in the zones [](Sniper_Valley.md), [](Sonorous_Dark.md), [](Stobe's_Gamble.md), [The Crags](The_Crags.md "wikilink"),
and [The Pits](The_Pits.md "wikilink").

[Sniper Valley](Sniper_Valley.md "wikilink") is likely to be exclusively
named after them.

They spawn alone and can be difficult to spot, allowing them chances for
a free shot using their crossbow, which is almost a guaranteed hit due
to their high ranged skills.

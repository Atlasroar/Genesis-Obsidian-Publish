**Mighty Canhead** is a unique character and member of the
[Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") faction. He will head a [](Mighty_Canhead_(Event).md) with 60+ other
[Cannibals](Cannibal.md "wikilink") if the players has an
[outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") in or near Cannibal
lands. Mighty Canhead can also attack if the player has been causing a
lot of trouble in the Cannibal plains, such as attacking the [](Cannibal_Grand_Wizard.md). If Mighty Canhead
loses the assault, he will try again within 4 days. If he succeeds,
there is a 10% chance that he will not return.

Mighty Canhead has a 20,000 Cats [Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") which can
be turned in at [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md), and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) police.

and its [Hot
Fix](https://steamcommunity.com/ogg/233860/announcements/detail/6762787542909557576)

- You are now able to add instances (nodes) to furniture etc. In the
  past you had to duplicate another piece with instances to utilize
  them.
- You can now edit one value on multiple open files. Use this ability
  wisely. Should be able to fe. add an animation file to all races at
  once now. Select them all then right click (not open them) on one and
  select "[Set Field](Using_the_FCS.md#Set_Field "wikilink")", this will
  let you edit that value on all the selected entries. This feature has
  actually been there the whole time, but it has been unknown to most
  modders before we had the proper documentation.
- Several added options in file, there is a button with ... next to the
  drop down menu on files. You can copy data from other files etc.
- Find and replace works now
- In the new FCS 2.0.1 update you can search the everything category of
  the FCS now, which allows you to find hidden entries that previously
  could not be accessed or searched easily. This includes entries for
  conditions and effects, which you can track back to lines using the
  reference check. This allows you to search for lines by what condition
  or effect they have.
- You can close all open windows using the thing under the main window x
  or the up right corner. This has also been there but previously
  commonly unknown.
- There's shortcuts now:
  - F3 - Show game world window
  - CTRL+W - close window
  - CTRL + SHIFT + W - Close all windows
  - CTRL + SHIFT + O - Open any file
  - CTRL + F - Search and replace

**Southern Hive Visit** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can
trigger if the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 1,500 meters of a
[Southern Hive](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink") owned location. It has a 40%
chance to trigger each day if within 1,300 meters, this chance scales
down with distance until it reaches 0% chance at 1,500 meters. It cannot
trigger if the [Queen of the South](Queen_of_the_South.md "wikilink") has
been killed or captured.

When the conditions are fulfilled, the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md) will send an assault to the player's
base. This assault will consist of two squads, each being made up of
either 8 [Droneguards](Droneguard.md "wikilink") led by a
[Prince](Prince.md "wikilink"), or 8-14
[Droneguards](Droneguard.md "wikilink") led by a
[Prince](Prince.md "wikilink").
![](Southern_Hive_Visit_Range.jpg "Southern_Hive_Visit_Range.jpg") Once
the assault arrives the War Leader will give a short speech demanding
the player leave their territory before starting the assault, attacking
gates and characters, and liberating captives. If the assault is
defeated, the [Hive Eviction](Hive_Eviction.md "wikilink") event has a 70%
chance to trigger in 24-48 hours. If the assault is victorious, the
assault party will occupy the base until forcibly removed by the player.

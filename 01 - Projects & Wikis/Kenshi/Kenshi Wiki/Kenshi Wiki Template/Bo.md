**Bo** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink") who is part of
the [Anti-Slavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink"). She can be found in [](Black_Scratch.md), accompanied by an [](Anti-Slaver_Jonin.md).

Despite her small stature, she is called 'Big' Bo by members of the
Anti-Slavers.

She is also capable of asking a squad of Anti-Slavers you encounter to
bodyguard your squad for three days. Strangely, this seems to work on
[Tinfist's](Tinfist.md "wikilink") squad, so one can potentially get
Tinfist and [Grey](Grey.md "wikilink") to follow them around.

She appears to always spawn wearing a Masterwork [](Dark_Leather_Shirt.md) if the squad size multiplier is at
1.0 (default game settings).

She is wanted by both the [United Cities](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") and
[The Holy Nation](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink").

## Interactions

**Big Bo** can be recruited if the player is an ally of the
[Anti-Slavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") and has killed or imprisoned:
[Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink"), [Lady Kana](Lady_Kana.md "wikilink"),
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink"), [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink"),
one of the Slave Masters, or one of the nobles. Bo will also join the
player if the player is an enemy of the [](Traders_Guild.md), [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), or [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md), but they will also need to capture a
noble.

If the player captures Bo then she can be recruited as long as the
player is not allied with the [United Cities](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"),
[The Holy Nation](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"), or the [](Traders_Guild.md).

## World States

If the player has killed or imprisoned Bo alongside
[Grey](Grey.md "wikilink") and [Jaegar](Jaegar.md "wikilink") while
[Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") is still alive, it will cause an
anti-slaver raid on a player's outpost.

If recruited, Bo can sometimes hail Anti-Slaver squads to follow the
player for three days.

## Trivia/Tips

- If training defense/dodge in Black Scratch be sure to avoid Bo's
  squadmate. The AI of her squad will cause the unit to pick you up when
  you are knocked unconscious but never drop you. If playing solo this
  is a hardlock as you are unable to free yourself and they will only
  move between the two bars in town.
- Bo is one of two NPCs with an actual set Robotics level. The other
  character who has a Robotics level set is Tinfist.

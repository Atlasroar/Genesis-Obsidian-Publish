**Port South** is a town controlled by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md). Despite being called a "port," this
town is essentially a [Stone Camp](Stone_Camp.md "wikilink") because it
contains many [stone mines](Stone_Mine.md "wikilink") and is largely
concentrated on producing raw stone and raw ore (alongside the fact that
it doesn't even have a harbor). [](Slave_Master_Wada.md) lives here in a [](Noble_House.md). You can find this town by venturing to
"middle" of the eastern seashore of [](The_Great_Desert.md) or by acquiring and reading the
**[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the United Cities (Central Territories)**.

Player can buy/free slaves from the multiple Slave Shops at this
location. Players could also sell some captives to Slave Shops to earn a
decent amount of cats. [Skimmers](Skimmer.md "wikilink") frequently attack
this town.

There is also another "port" in **The Great Desert,** called [](Port_North.md) and it is controlled by [](Lady_Kana.md).

## Trivia

Designation of this town as a "port" is yet another indication that the
world of [Kenshi](World_of_Kenshi.md "wikilink") used to have maritime
transport. Shipment of raw materials produced on site over the sea would
have been more practical and convenient than using desert caravans.
Other indications that Kenshi used to have some form of ships are their
carcasses scattered in some zones and an occasional monologue that
[Skeleton](Skeleton_(Race).md "wikilink") characters would utter upon
entering [the Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink").

However, due to the fact that this "port" does not contain a usable
harbor unlike the **Port North**, it is less likely that it is
designated as an ancient building but rather because it is named so
because it's next to the sea. But one could also handwave the
explanation that sea levels dropped over the time causing the shore to
become farther away.

**Slaver Guards** are common soldiers of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md). They are frequently found in
slaver-owned towns and act as guards and patrols to the establishments
within.

Despite their status as guards, they are no stronger than the typical
[Slaver](Slaver.md "wikilink") - though they do wear better
[Armour](Armour.md "wikilink").

They have a chance to spawn with a [Ranger](Ranger.md "wikilink") crossbow
to differentiate them from their [](Slaver_Heavy_Guard.md).

**Kenshi 2** is an upcoming prequel to [Kenshi](Kenshi.md "wikilink") still
under development by Lo-Fi Games. Set around 1,000 years prior to the
original game[^1], the setting will still be in a post-apocalyptic state
during this time period[^2], and may have only slightly more advanced
technology[^3].

Though originally intended to use the latest version of
[OGRE](wikipedia:OGRE "wikilink") as its engine, it was later changed to
[Unreal Engine 4](wikipedia:Unreal_Engine "wikilink")[^4]. There is
currently no confirmed release date. Unlike Kenshi, the game will likely
not pursue an early access release as the funding is not needed, which
would significantly speed up development. There is, however, a potential
beta phase towards the end of development to assist with bug
testing[^5].

Currently major known planned features include a larger and expanded
world[^6], with new and old landmasses to explore[^7], more dynamic
faction interactions[^8], a district system for NPC towns[^9], as well
as a major new game changing system that is being kept secret[^10].
Multiplayer is not planned for the game[^11].

Hivers are confirmed to be a returning race, with some additions to the
variety of their appearance [^12]. While it is highly likely that the
other races will return as well, they have yet to be officially
confirmed.

Potential new features may include wall climbing [^13], and boats
[^14][^15], but so far remain unconfirmed.

The development team has started working on new modding tools.

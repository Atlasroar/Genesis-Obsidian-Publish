**Shrieking Bandits** are members of the [](Shrieking_Bandits.md) faction. They can be found in
groups of 9-26 in [Cannibal Plains](Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink"), [](Purple_Sands.md), and [](The_Shrieking_Forest.md) where they make their home.

One can easily spot them because they frequently make shrieking noises
as they roam around.

## Interactions

Shrieking Bandits may randomly strike what passes for a conversation
with a character. If the character shrieks back or picks the right
dialogue options, the shrieking squad will go home. The wrong choice
will lead to an attack.

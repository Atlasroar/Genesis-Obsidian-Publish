A **CPU Unit** is an [item](Items.md "wikilink") which can primarily be
found in ancient locations. It serves no function outside of being worth
a decent amount of money.

There are many unique CPU items which can be looted from specific
skeletons, as well as a non-unique [](Old_CPU_Unit.md) which can be found the same way.

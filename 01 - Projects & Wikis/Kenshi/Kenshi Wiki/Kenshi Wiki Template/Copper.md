**Copper** is a material found across the land used to make anything
electrical and much more. Presently it can only be mined from Copper
outcrops by using the [Labouring](Labouring.md "wikilink") skill. Large
deposits are also found [under ground](Prospecting.md "wikilink"), but it
is impossible to reach them in an unmodded game.

![](Slave.shop.jpg "Slave.shop.jpg")**Slave Shops** are shops run by the
[Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink") faction that
sell characters that have been captured, shackled and turned
into [slaves](Slavery.md "wikilink"). They generally consist of many iron
cages, along with chests for confiscated possessions. Slave Shops are
fixtures in most [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") settlements,
where slavery is a form of commerce; though the [](Holy_Nation.md) employs slave labor, no Slave Shops are
available in their cities.

Slave shops will spawn with a handful of already enslaved characters,
though [Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink"), [](Slave_Hunters.md) and
[Manhunters](Manhunters.md "wikilink") will periodically 'restock' the shop
by picking up unconscious characters and placing them in the cages (the
vice-versa could also happen where Slave Traders patrols relocate the
slaves to one of the nearest slave camp) These factions will enslave any
unconscious character they encounter, not only those they have
personally defeated. This presents a danger in the event that a player's
characters are incapacitated in or near a town in the United Cities;
rather than being apprehended by the police or left to be rescued by
other characters in the player's faction, there exists the possibility
that they are instead cast into slavery.

The player can purchase slaves from a slave shop, though it is not
guaranteed that they will become a member of the player's faction. One
effectively buys a slave's freedom, with the same result as breaking
them out of the cage and unlocking the shackles.

Slave Shops stay open all night, making it difficult to break in and
flee slaves from their cages. Further, once freed, slaves will generally
either flee the city at full speed or follow the player in anticipation
of leaving the city; in either case, the town guards will generally
brutalize and recapture them. Freeing slaves is effective
[Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink") training but when seen counts as
"terrorism" and will incur a [Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink"). If the player
can manage to safely escort a slave some distance outside the city's
walls, they can also provide a source of fresh recruits.

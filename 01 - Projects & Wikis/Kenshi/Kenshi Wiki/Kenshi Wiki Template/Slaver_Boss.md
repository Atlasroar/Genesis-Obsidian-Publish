A **Slaver Boss** is the shopkeeper of a Slave Shop. He usually has a
higher quality weapon and will purchase slaves which the player is
carrying. He will also sell slaves to the player, including enslaved
player characters.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is also
separately attached to this character, although it is the same colour as
the faction's colour.

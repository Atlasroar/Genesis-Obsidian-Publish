**Holy Nation Outlaws** are a [Faction](Factions.md "wikilink") of former
slaves, ex-servants, and runaway criminals who escaped from [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). While not inherently hostile to the
player, they will sometimes attack out of a need for food. They can also
be recruited on occasion out in the wilderness. They will often have the
same dialogue reactions as the Holy Nation when spotting skeleton player
characters, but do not attack on sight unless the player is already an
enemy.

**Industry Buildings** are buildings which turn raw materials into
refined items. These buildings do not require a crafting queue to be
used by characters.

## Stone Processing

Early game, most [Construction](Construction.md "wikilink") requires
Building Materials. These can be purchased from a Trader but can easily
be researched and crafted inside a Player Outpost.

### Stone Mines

[Raw Stone](Raw_Stone.md "wikilink") can be mined from a [](Stone_Mine.md). Stone Mines can be upgraded with the
research ??

### Stone Processors

Stone can be processed into [](Building_Materials.md) with a [](Stone_Processor.md). Stone Processors can be upgraded
with research into ??

## Iron Refining

[Raw Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink") can be mined from an Iron Deposit in
most Regions. These Deposits can be found through
[Prospecting](Prospecting.md "wikilink").

### Ore Drills

Characters can build an [Ore Drill](Ore_Drill.md "wikilink") after
researching [Ore Drill](Ore_Drill_(Tech).md "wikilink"). These Ore Drills
can be built in areas away from Iron Deposits. After researching [](Fully_Automatic_Ore_Drill_(Tech).md), these
Ore Drills no longer require workers.

### Iron Refineries

[Iron Plates](Iron_Plate.md "wikilink") can be created by refining Raw
Iron. After researching [Iron Plates](Iron_Plates_(Tech).md "wikilink"),
characters can build an [Iron Refinery](Iron_Refinery.md "wikilink").

### Steel Refineries

[Steel Bars](Steel_Bars.md "wikilink") can be created by further refining
Iron Plates. After researching [](Steel_Bars_(Tech).md), characters can build a [](Steel_Refinery.md).

## Copper Refining

[Raw Copper](Raw_Copper.md "wikilink") can be mined from a Copper Deposit
in most Regions. These Deposits can be found through
[Prospecting](Prospecting.md "wikilink").

### Â Electrical Workbench

At an [Electrical Workbench](Electrical_Workbench.md "wikilink"),
characters can turn [Raw Copper](Raw_Copper.md "wikilink") into [](Electrical_Components.md). This workstation trains
the [Science](Science.md "wikilink") skill while in use.

This workbench can be built after researching [](Electrical_Crafting_(Tech).md).

### Copper Alloy Bench

At a [Copper Alloy Bench](Copper_Alloy_Bench.md "wikilink"), characters can
turn [Raw Copper](Raw_Copper.md "wikilink") and [](Iron_Plate.md) into [](Copper_Alloy_Plates.md). This workstation trains the
[Engineer](Engineer.md "wikilink") skill while in use.

This workbench can be built after researching [](Copper_Alloys_(Tech).md). __NOEDITSECTION__

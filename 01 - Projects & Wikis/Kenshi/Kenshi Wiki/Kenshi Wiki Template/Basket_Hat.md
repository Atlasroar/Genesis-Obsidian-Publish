## Trivia

The item is based on the Tengai Hat, a special hat worn by the Komusō.
Komusō was a sect of Japanese Zen Buddhist monks who traveled the
country, living as beggars. Due to the monks' ability to move across
Japan with no restrictions, many dressed like Komusō to act as spies or
assassins.

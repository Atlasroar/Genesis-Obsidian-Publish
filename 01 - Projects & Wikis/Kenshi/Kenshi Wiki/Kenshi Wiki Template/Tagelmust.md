It also has a chainmail
[blackened](Blackened_Chainmail_Tagelmust.md "wikilink") and
[rusted](Rusty_Chainmail_Tagelmust.md "wikilink") version.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **3x3**.

## Appearance

![](Black_tagelmust.jpg "Black_tagelmust.jpg") Made from what looks like
one sheet of cloth, the Tagelmust is wapped around the character's head
in a manner that leaves the face exposed while covering the neck,
forehead and the top of the head.

There is a bug/feature found in v1.0.51. When [Cat](Cat.md "wikilink")
wears an ordinary Tagelmust it becomes black while its name and all the
stats remain the same.

## Stats

Located between [Cannibal Plains](Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink") and
[Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink"). As the name implies, the
**Floodlands** is a flooded swamp with a never ending downpour making
this a gloomy area to travel. The region is also known for the ancient
structures that remain suggesting the area was industrialized and might
explain why the environment is now dead. The only thing roaming these
lands are [Iron Spiders](Iron_Spider.md "wikilink") and [](Security_Spider.md).

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") or [](Minor_Outposts.md) in this zone. There are no
[Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps which spawn in the Floodlands.

### Minor Outposts

*These locations are typically small towns, villages, or faction bases.*

- [Burn's Tower](Burn's_Tower.md "wikilink"), where the [](Unique_Recruits.md) [Burn](Burn.md "wikilink") can be
  found, is located in the north Floodlands.

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink")
- [Suspicious Lab](Suspicious_Lab.md "wikilink")
- [Leaning Tower](Leaning_Tower.md "wikilink") ( Not guarded but still a
  few books inside. 98 Stealth cannot sneak past spiders.)

## Lore

Floodlands bears the scars visible from the vast amount of dead area due
to exploitation, it has traditionally been chartered to one
megacorporation to another to feed the industrial maw of the Old Empire,
which always hungers yet is never satisfied. The water that rains here
also gets transported to Okran's Pride via Wend and then to Border Zone
and ultimately leaving the water to The Swamps. But seems to have
majority of the flow blockaded by a junk reef.

## Environment

### Weather

*This zone has the 'floodland' season. Seasons may cause harmful
[Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") or be purely aesthetic.*

- Misty rain

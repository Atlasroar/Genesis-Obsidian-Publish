## Appearance

Longcoat is a leather trench coat made from a light brown leather. It
has rolled-up sleeves that come down to elbow level. The Longcoat has a
tall thick collar that protects the neck of the character. The coat is
held shut by two featureless leather belts around the waist.

The longcoats worn by females are somewhat different, with the inner
part of the longcoat a much darker shade of brown. Four featureless
belts are wrapped around the character, two over the longcoat's open
waist, one under the chest and one over it. It also appears longer than
the male variant.

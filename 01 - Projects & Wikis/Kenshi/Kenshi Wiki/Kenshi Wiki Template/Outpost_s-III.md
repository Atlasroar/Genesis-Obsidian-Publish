<img src="Outpost_III.png" title="Outpost_III.png" width="200"
height="200" alt="Outpost_III.png" /> **Outpost s-III** are large
building models that require appropriate
[technologies](Outpost_Type_(Tech).md "wikilink") to be researched in order
to be built. As the in game description suggests, these building types
construct well on awkward or uneven terrain.

The Outpost s-III are also superior to other buildings because they have
an outside ramp instead of stairs (characters can often get stuck in the
space under exterior stairs in [Storm Houses](Storm_House.md "wikilink")
and [Stephouses](Stephouse.md "wikilink")). The metal Outpost s-III towers
are much safer for descending to the street or ascending into the
building.

There are limitations with regard to furnishing of these towers. Beware
that due to low ceiling, not every [](Buildings_List.md) can fit inside. For example, a
[Heavy Armour Smithy](Heavy_Armour_Smithy.md "wikilink") is impossible to
fit on its first floor due to its height. Similarly no
furniture/interior building can be constructed on the exterior "ring"
walkway of the Outpost s-III tower because that space is qualified as
"outside". The [Outpost s-IV](Outpost_s-IV.md "wikilink") gives the player
more opportunities in terms of furnishing the structure.

Outpost s-III can be purchased in the following cities and towns:

- [Catun](Catun.md "wikilink")
- [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink")

## Trivia

The **Outpost s-III** types can technically be placed on top of
[Stationhouses](Stationhouse.md "wikilink"). This could have been an
amazing opportunity to create spacious palace-like structures. It is
however impossible to regulate the height of the new construction,
leaving the outpost uselessly handing above the Stationhouse structure.
Using the FCS might help you to construct one building on top of another
correctly.

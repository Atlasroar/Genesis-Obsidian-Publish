**Hundred Guardians** are the elite soldiers of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) and highly skilled fighters. They are
neutral but distasteful of [Human](Human.md "wikilink") characters, often
calling them "[Flatskins](Flatskins.md "wikilink")" like most other members
of the Shek Kingdom. Their heavy armor makes them easy to outrun even
for new characters.

They guard the [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") capital [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink")
and the city [Squin](Squin.md "wikilink"), and are found as patrol leaders
leading [Shek Warriors](Shek_Warrior.md "wikilink").

They will never have the Maniacal or Fearful
[Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

If [Esata the Stone Golem](Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") is [](World_States.md) then they will swear allegiance to
[Flying Bull](Flying_Bull.md "wikilink") and will start to spawn as members
of the [Kral's Chosen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md "wikilink").

## Interactions

Once allied with the Shek Kingdom, a player can talk to wandering
patrols of **Hundred Guardians** to ask them to bodyguard the player or
guard their outpost. They will then follow the player for 72 hours or
guard their outpost for 48 hours.

Note that the Hundred Guardians guarding towns can be talked to but will
refuse to follow, redirecting the player to look for patrolling Hundred
Guardians outside Shek cities.**Hundred Guardians**will bodyguard the
player for an additional 6 hours if the player's squad is downed when
the bodyguard contract ends.

**Hundred Guardians**will toss the player a single piece of [](Dried_Meat.md) if they see them starving.

Hundred Guardians can lead medium-level importance assaults against a
[player's outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"), the [](Enemy_Hunt.md) and [](Shek_Revenge.md).

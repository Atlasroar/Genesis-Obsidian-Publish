**Ration Pack** is a [Food](Food.md "wikilink") item which cannot be cooked
by the player (which is technically a bug). Ration Packs, including
[Ancient Nutri-Rations](Ancient_Nutri-Rations.md "wikilink"), are currently
the best nutrition you can get.

### Locations

These Ration Packs can be purchased from relevant
[Traders](Traders.md "wikilink"), usually [Bars](Bars.md "wikilink") or trade
caravans.

There is a possibility that the following characters will give the
player a Ration Pack as a gesture of good will.

- [High Paladin](High_Paladin.md "wikilink")
- [Holy Sentinel](Holy_Sentinel.md "wikilink")
- [Paladin](Paladin.md "wikilink")
- [Protector of the Flame](Protector_of_the_Flame.md "wikilink")

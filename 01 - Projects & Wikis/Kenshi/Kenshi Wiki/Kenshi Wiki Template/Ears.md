**Ears** is the person in [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink") who can help
characters 'get noticed'. Ears is a member of the
[Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") and has [](Diplomatic_Status.md). They can be found in either Bar
in [Shark](Shark.md "wikilink") and will refuse to interact with you if you
are allied with the [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink"),
preventing you from allying with the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") (but
not vice-versa). The same is also true if you are allied with [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), or [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md). If you break the alliance with any
of said factions, you will be able to speak to him again.

## Trivia

Unlike other **Hound** members, **Ears** is specifically a
[Scorchlander](Scorchlander.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- Compared mentally to the Soldier Drones and the Princes, the Workers
  are smarter than the Soldiers, but not as intelligent as a Prince.
- Hive Worker Drones have the lowest vision range multiplier in Kenshi.
  (Tied with their South Hive variant, Crabs, Swamp Turtles and Iron
  Spiders) Because of this it is common for a Hive Worker Drone Guard to
  be unaware if an ally of theirs nearby is under attack.

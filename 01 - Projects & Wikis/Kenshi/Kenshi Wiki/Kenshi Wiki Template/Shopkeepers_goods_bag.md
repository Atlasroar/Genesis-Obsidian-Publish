The **Shopkeeper's Goods Bag** is a very large
[Backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") with a weight of 100 kg. As it weighs a
ton it can be used to help encumber your character to
[Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") train but any fights will be made very
difficult.

They cannot be bought, so to obtain one they must be taken from a
Shopkeepers. Usually carried by ones in General stores. An easy way to
tell if a Shopkeeper is wearing a Shopkeepers good bag and not a Traders
Backpack Large is to check their movement speed. If they are slowed down
via encumbrance they have a Shopkeepers goods bag.

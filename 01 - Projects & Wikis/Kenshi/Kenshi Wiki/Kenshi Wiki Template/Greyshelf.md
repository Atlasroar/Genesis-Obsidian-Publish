**Greyshelf** is a zone in the southeast. It comprises the entirety of
the highlands above [Stobe's Gamble](Stobe's_Gamble.md "wikilink") and is
separated from [Royal Valley](Royal_Valley.md "wikilink") by a mountain
range. It is primarily inhabited by the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md), with their heartlands to the south of
this area.

It is notable for it's abundance of [Gorillos](Gorillo.md "wikilink") and
[Black Gorillos](Black_Gorillo.md "wikilink"). Most locations that can be
found here are [armouries](Armoury_Ruin.md "wikilink"), some of which have
been [claimed](Hiver-Claimed_Armoury.md "wikilink") by the Southern Hive.

Care should be taken as Acid Rain weather effect can happen in this
area.

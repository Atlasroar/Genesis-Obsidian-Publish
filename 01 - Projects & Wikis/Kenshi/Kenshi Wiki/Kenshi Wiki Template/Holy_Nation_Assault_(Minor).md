**Holy Nation Assault (Minor)**, simply referred to as 'Holy Nation
Assault' in-game, is an [event](Events.md "wikilink") that can occur if the
player failed to fulfil [Prayer Day](Prayer_Day.md "wikilink") requirements
or was seen by patrols that the outpost built in their territory goes
against [The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") interests (i.e
Having only women in the outpost, or having non-humans in the outpost)
and failed to pacify the patrol commander. It is closely related to, but
not to be confused with, two other events of the same name, [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Major).md), and [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Inquisitor).md).

The event cannot trigger if the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) has been killed or captured in
the case of the Prayer Day retaliation, while the race and women
triggered variants require the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), and [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) to be killed or captured in
order to be stopped.

After the requirements above are met, [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) will send an assault in 10-48 hours
depending on the trigger used, this patrol will consist of 3-4
[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), 5 [](Holy_Sentinel.md) and 10-15 [](Holy_Chosen.md) with one additional
[Paladin](Paladin.md "wikilink") acting as the War Leader for this event.
After the War Leader has arrived to the designated players outpost he
will then give a speech about the reason of attacking and say the player
will be 'disciplined', during which the player might have a final chance
to prevent the conflict if they have a human male and the original
trigger was for only having women at the outpost, at which point the
raid will be cancelled and [Prayer Day](Prayer_Day.md "wikilink") will
launch in 150 to 160 hours. If not pacified this patrol will then
proceed to attack the outpost and the player characters inside it.

If the raid is victorious, they will occupy the player's base,
patrolling around it, using the furniture, freeing captives, and
imprisoning your characters. If the raid is defeated, there is a 100%
chance to trigger a [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Major).md) event 72 to 110 hours
afterward.

A forgotten workshop location in the [Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink")
which contains 25-28 [](Error_Code_0xFFFFFF.md) characters. Not quite broken
but definitely missing a few bolts. The first person to come into
contact with them will become their ally whom they will follow and
protect with extreme prejudice. They will yell "Protect Master!" and
attack anything that can possibly be conceived as a threat, as well as
stare you down.

The skeletons are very useful in a fight. They soak up and deal solid
damage while also being able to be repaired. Treated well, they can last
quite a while and are an asset in any assault on other workshops or the
[Black Desert City](Black_Desert_City.md "wikilink"). Beware, however, as
they will often go agro on any random folks you meet including those you
just want to be friends with.

In the workshop you can find a few lootable boxes and 6 deactivated
skeleton repair benches, upstairs is 1-2 containers, a strongbox and an
ancient vault.

This location can be discovered by exploration or by reading the **Old
Treasure [Map](Maps.md "wikilink")** (that can unlock one location from a
list that includes the Reprogramming Workshop).

The **Thieves' Backpack** is a medium [backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink")
that reduces encumbrance by 60% and does not hinder your stealth. It
slightly hinders combat skills (Attack and Defense) by -2 points, which
is equal to the ordinary small backpack, and less than any of the larger
standard issue backpacks, but still worse than the [](Small_Thieves_Backpack.md).

The inventory size of this backpack is 10 by 14 tiles, which is the same
as the [Medium Backpack](Medium_Backpack.md "wikilink").

The Thieves Backpack can be purchased from General [](Item_Trader.md) at [World's End](World's_End.md "wikilink")
settlement for c.5,000 as well as any of the [Shinobi Thieves
traders](https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Shinobi_Trader) for c.2,500.
Additionally, the backpack can be bought at adventure trader stores,
though they appear to be sold only occasionally.

It should be noted that the [](Shinobi_Thieves.md)' trader always sells items at a 50%
discount, though one is required to be a member of this thieves guild in
order to trade with the merchant in the first place. [ru:Воровской

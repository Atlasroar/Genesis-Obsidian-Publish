One of the [Suspicious Settler's](Suspicious_Settler.md "wikilink") pets,
along with the [Beloved Goat](Beloved_Goat.md "wikilink"). Can be found in
the [Gatherer Villages](Gatherer_Village.md "wikilink") west of the city
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"). Will come to the aid of the
[Settler](Suspicious_Settler.md "wikilink") if he is attacked.

It is slightly stronger than the average [Bonedog](Bonedog.md "wikilink"),
with 5 higher base stats. It also has a unique set scale min + max which
causes it to have 214 health when age 1.1 which is 34 more than a normal
Bonedog. Settlers Pup is unique because it is the only animal which
spawns with no death item (so, it cannot die from butchering. Bandits
will still attempt to butcher the animal, but nothing will happen as a
result of it).

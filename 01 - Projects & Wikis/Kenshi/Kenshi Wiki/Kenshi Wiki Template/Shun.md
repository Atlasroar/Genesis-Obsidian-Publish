**Shun** is an abandoned region at the southwestern corner of Kenshi.
There are many ruins and lost ancient locations. Aside from scavenging,
there is not much to do in Shun.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") or [](Minor_Outposts.md) in Shun. This zone does not spawn
[Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps.

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Armoury Ruin](Armoury_Ruin.md "wikilink")

nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

## Tips

- Unlike in most of the other regions where they can be found, Tech
  Hunters may start unprovoked fights with the player.
- Roaming Garrus might be baited to attacking enemies garrisoning the
  Lost Armoury and the coastal Lost Library, distracting them enough to
  loot both places.
- This region is a good place to find some of the early research
  artefacts. Looting all of the six Lost Libraries can net around 8
  [Ancient Science Books](Ancient_Science_Book.md "wikilink") and 25
  [Books](Book.md "wikilink"). Other paper loot includes around 75
  [Parchments](Parchment.md "wikilink"), 40 [Old Maps](Old_Map.md "wikilink")
  and 500-600 Damaged books that can be sold for over 23000 cats.

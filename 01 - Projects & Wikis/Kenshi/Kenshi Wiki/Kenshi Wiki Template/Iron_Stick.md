An **Iron Stick** is essentially just a simple metal rod. It is the
favoured weapon of very low tier characters such as [](Scrawny_Cannibal.md) and [Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink").

This weapon has inventory dimensions of **1x7**. It can therefore be
equipped in both the primary and secondary weapon slots. It cannot be
manufactured nor found in many of the quality variants in the base game.

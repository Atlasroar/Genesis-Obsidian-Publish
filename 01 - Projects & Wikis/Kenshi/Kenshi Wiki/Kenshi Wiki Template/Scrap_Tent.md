**Scrap Tents** are [Camping](Camping.md "wikilink")
[buildings](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") which the player can construct
anywhere after learning the blueprint. They require very few materials
in order to construct and do not result in the creation of a [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md). Camps can be used as a
quick shelter from [weather effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink"),
specifically acid rain and burning.

Scrap Tents may be the easier choice to build in the wilderness, as its
construction materials can be looted from animals. Players hoping to
construct [other](Mercenary_Tent.md "wikilink")
[tents](Flat_Shelter.md "wikilink") should think ahead and carry
[Fabrics](Fabrics.md "wikilink") for their construction.

The blueprint can be purchased from any of these locations:

- [Adventurer Bar](Adventurer_Bar.md "wikilink")
- [Flats Lagoon Bar](Flats_Lagoon_Bar.md "wikilink")
- [Shark Travel Shop](Shark_Travel_Shop.md "wikilink")
- [Tech Hunter Shop](Tech_Hunter_Shop.md "wikilink")
- [Travel and Repairs Shop](Travel_and_Repairs_Shop.md "wikilink")
- [Travel Gear](Travel_Gear.md "wikilink")

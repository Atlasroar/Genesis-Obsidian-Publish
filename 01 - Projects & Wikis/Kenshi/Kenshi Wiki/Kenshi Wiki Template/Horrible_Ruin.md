The **Horrible Ruin** is a dilapidated village found in the eastern part
of [Cheaters Run](Cheaters_Run.md "wikilink").

It's labelled as a location that belongs to the
[Deadcat](Deadcat.md "wikilink") faction despite being inhabited solely by
[Skin Bandits](Skin_Bandits.md "wikilink").

Initially, when the player sees this location in the distance, the name
for it is "Nice Ruin." Upon closer inspection, they realize this is not
the case.

## Trivia

- After a Skin Bandit finishes its dialogue in this location all nearby
  Skin Bandits are drawn to your location at the time the dialogue was
  completed. They will not be drawn to your location if you are already
  hostile to Skin Bandits or attack before the dialogue is over. This is
  the only location where this happens outside of the nearby [](Police_Barracks.md).
- This location is technically still controlled by Deadcat, meaning that
  Skin Harvests will never originate from this location.

**Dust Bandit Bowmen**are members of the [](Dust_Bandits.md). 

Up to 4 of them spawn in a squad, led by a [](Dust_Boss.md) and  accompanied by 5-10 [](Dust_Bandit.md) . These squads can be found roaming
[Shem](Shem.md "wikilink") or the [Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink").

They also populate [Dust Bandit Camps](Dust_Bandit_Camp.md "wikilink"),
which spawn in the aforementioned biomes, with the addition of
[Skinner's Roam](Skinner's_Roam.md "wikilink"). These camps contain 3 Dust
Bandit squads, which are slightly larger than their roaming
counterparts.

They can also be found in the [](Dust_King_Tower.md) as guards, in the same number as in
the roaming squads.

Finally, they are part of the [](Bandit_Demands.md) event squad which is sent to the
player's outpost if it lies within the Dust Bandits' zone of control.
They are differentiated from their melee counterparts by always spawning
with a crossbow. However, as the normal dust bandit also has a chance to
spawn with a crossbow, the bowman's spiked club is a better visual
indicator of this variant.

The **Harpoon Turret**is a building under the Defence category. It
requires the [Harpoon Turrets tech](Harpoon_Turrets_(Tech).md "wikilink")
line to build.

Like the [Mounted Crossbow](Mounted_Crossbow.md "wikilink") it is primarily
used to guard an outpost or a building. It can be attached on the edges
of buildings and walls at certain nodes, or placed freely.

They train a user's [Perception](Perception.md "wikilink") and
[Turrets](Turrets.md "wikilink") skill when used. Reloading trains
[Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink") and shooting an ally trains [](Precision_Shooting.md).

The range, accuracy, and speed of a turret is modified by the operator's
related skills. The previously mentioned attributes as well as damage is
affected based off the height difference between the turret and its
target. Turrets will be more effective if fired from above, and less
effective when fired from below.

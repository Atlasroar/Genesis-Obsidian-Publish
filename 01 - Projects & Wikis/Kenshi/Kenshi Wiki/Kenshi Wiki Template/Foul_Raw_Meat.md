**Foul Raw Meat** is a [Food](Food.md "wikilink") item which can be
gathered from many [Animals](Fauna.md "wikilink") and the humanoid Fishmen.
It is edible for [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink") characters (except for Hive
[Princes](Hive_Prince.md "wikilink")) and [](Fauna.md#Domesticated). It can also be added to the
[Animal Feeder](Animal_Feeder.md "wikilink"). While the nutritional value
of 10 is considered low, high amounts can be harvested from most
creatures.

**Western Hive**is a village by the [](Western_Hive.md) located on an island in
[Vain](Vain.md "wikilink"). The surrounding water is acidic and harms Shek
and Human characters.

Upon landing on the island you will be met by a swarm of [](Soldier_Drone.md) patrolling the area. Entering the Hill
Hut will allow you to see [The Queen](The_Queen.md "wikilink") and her
[Royal Soldier Drones](Royal_Soldier_Drone.md "wikilink"). The island lacks
any shops or places to recover from the harmful water.

## Buildings

## Town Overrides

## Trivia

Unlike the [Southern Hive](Southern_Hive_(Location).md "wikilink") who uses
a major town icon, **Western Hive** uses a minor outpost icon.

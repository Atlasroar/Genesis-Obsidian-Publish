**Membership Pack** is a [unique item](Unique_Items.md "wikilink") which is
given to the player through dialogue from [Yamdu](Yamdu.md "wikilink") when
the player becomes allied with the [](Traders_Guild.md). Despite the item description's
worries, it is never asked for again by any other characters.

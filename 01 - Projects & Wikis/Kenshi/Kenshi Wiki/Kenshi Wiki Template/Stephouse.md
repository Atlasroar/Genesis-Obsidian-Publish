The **Stephouse** is one of the large buildings that can be constructed
by the player. It requires the [](Large_Building_Shells_(Tech).md) research to build.

Like the [L-House](L-House.md "wikilink"), its ceiling and roof are
separated into two parts. The two levels of the ceiling are connected by
a ladder. Lights placed on the higher ceiling of this building will not
illuminate the floor directly under them, forcing the player to use
either [torches](Torch_Post.md "wikilink") or [](Electrical_Torch_Post.md) for lighting.

This building can be purchased in the following cities and towns:

- [Stoat](Stoat.md "wikilink")
- [Brink](Brink.md "wikilink")
- [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink")
- ...

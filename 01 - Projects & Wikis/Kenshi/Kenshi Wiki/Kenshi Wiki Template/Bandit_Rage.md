**Bandit Rage** is an [Event](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger in
response to stabbing the [Dust Boss](Dust_Boss.md "wikilink") War Leader
during dialog in the [Bandit Demands](Bandit_Demands.md "wikilink") event.

Once the conditions have been fulfilled, the [](Dust_Bandits.md) will send an assault to the [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md). This assault will
consist of 3-6 squads, each made up of 0-4 [](Dust_Bandit_Bowman.md), 5-10 [](Dust_Bandit.md), led by a [](Dust_Boss.md).

Once the assault arrives the War Leader will give a short speech before
ordering the attack to begin, attacking gates and characters, and
liberating captives. If the attackers are victorious, the [](Bandit_Demands.md) event will trigger in 40-50 hours.

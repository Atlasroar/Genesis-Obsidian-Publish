**Holy Chosen**Â are fighters for the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) that can be found on the front lines
against the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"). If certain World
States are achieved, they can be found counter-attacking the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md). Holy Chosen can be found patrolling
in large numbers making up the bulk of the army alongside a few more
experienced [Holy Sentinels](Holy_Sentinel.md "wikilink") and
[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink").

Based on their appearance and weapons, Holy Chosen appear to be [](Holy_Servant.md) that have been "chosen" to serve on
the front lines. They possibly also include volunteering crusaders and
conscripted [townsfolk](Holy_Citizen.md "wikilink") and
[peasants](Holy_Farmer.md "wikilink").

Holy Chosen may be on the path to become [](Holy_Sentinel.md), taking this period to familiarize
themselves with the Combat Cleaver, a Sentinel's weapon of choice.
Still, their lack of armour and limited swordsmanship results in them
having a very low life expectancy, so they are mostly just cannon fodder
in practice. Since Holy Servants, and by extension most of the Chosen
are likely slaves, this weeding out process may be intentional.

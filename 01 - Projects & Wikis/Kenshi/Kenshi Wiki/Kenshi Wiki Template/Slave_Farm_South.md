**Slave Farm South** in [The Hook](The_Hook.md "wikilink") is where
characters are taken after they are enslaved by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) or [](Slave_Hunters.md). Slaves can also come from the
characters who break the law in [](Drifter's_Last.md) and are then given to the Slavers.

There is also another slave farm, called simply the [](Slave_Farm.md). It is controlled by [](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md) and is located in
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink").

Slave Farm South is the home of [](Slave_Mistress_Grace.md).

## Tips

- If you're being brought to the Slave Farm from [](Drifter's_Last.md), the slavers will have to swim to get
  there. While in the water, they can't attack you for escaping. They
  will not chase you if you swim away from them.
- The easiest way to escape from inside the Slave Farm is to wait until
  your character is being ordered to farm in one of the farms outside of
  the walls. Remove the "obedient slave" job and start running to the
  [Waystation](Waystation_(The_Hook).md "wikilink"). Before this, you
  should already pick the lock on your shackles so that you can remove
  them while running away.

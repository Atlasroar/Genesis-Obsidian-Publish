**Outlaw Farmers**are members of the [](Rebel_Farmers.md).

They can be found patrolling several biomes, usually in the UC
territories: [Grey Desert](Grey_Desert.md "wikilink"),
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"), [Sinkuun](Sinkuun.md "wikilink"),
[Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink"), [](The_Great_Desert.md), and [](The_Hook.md). They patrol these areas in groups of 3-10,
usually led by groups of the stronger [](Outlaw_Swordsman.md), so long as [](Boss_Simion.md) is alive. A smaller squad consisting of
3-7 Outlaw Farmers can spawn from [Raider Camps](Raider_Camp.md "wikilink")
that dot Heng or The Great Desert.

There are at least 7-10 that spawn in the HQ of the Rebel Farmers -
[Fort Simion](Fort_Simion.md "wikilink").

They can spawn as squatters in [Bast](Bast.md "wikilink"),
[Endin](Endin.md "wikilink"), [Heft](Heft.md "wikilink") (empire peasant),
[Stoat](Stoat.md "wikilink") (tech hunter), and [](Manhunter_Base.md) (merc guild).

If UC cities devolve into civil war due to the loss of the resident
noble or [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink"), they can be seen
fighting for control on the streets.

Additionally, they serve as gate guards for Fort Simion, and small towns
the peasants have taken over: [Port North](Port_North.md "wikilink"), [](Port_South.md), [](Slave_Farm_South.md), and [](Trader's_Edge.md) (if [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") is
dead).

They have a 10% chance to spawn with a bounty ranging from 300 to 1300
Cats.

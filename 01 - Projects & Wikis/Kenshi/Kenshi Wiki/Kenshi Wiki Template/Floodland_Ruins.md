**Floodland Ruins** is a faction label for ruins in the
[Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink"). There are no roaming squads
attributed to this faction. All characters found in the Floodlands are
likely to be members of the [Old Machines](Old_Machines.md "wikilink")
faction.

Strangely a single ruin belonging to this faction can be found in the
[Stenn Desert](Stenn_Desert.md "wikilink").

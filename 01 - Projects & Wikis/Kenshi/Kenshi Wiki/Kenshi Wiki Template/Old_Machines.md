**Old Machines**are a faction of hostile robots that wander some of the
more dangerous areas of the world, usually locations where lost ruins
and similar places are prevalent. Some things indicate some of them may
be malfunctioning, or perhaps following ancient programming. Regardless,
they are hostile and will attack nearly anyone on sight.

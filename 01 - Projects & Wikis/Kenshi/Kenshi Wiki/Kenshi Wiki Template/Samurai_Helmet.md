The **Samurai Helmet** is part of the basic armour of Samurai. It
belongs to the Heavy Armour Class and is part of the samurai armour
series together with [Samurai Armour](Samurai_Armour.md "wikilink"),
[Samurai Legplates](Samurai_Legplates.md "wikilink") and [](Samurai_Boots.md). The Samurai Helmet can be
[dyed](Colour_Scheme.md "wikilink").

A rusted and stat-wise inferior
[version](Ancient_Samurai_Helmet.md "wikilink") of Samurai Helmet was set
to appear in game but does not spawn due to being assigned to characters
that can't wear them.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **3x3**.

## Appearance

The main body of the helmet appears to crafted from one sheet of metal
plate. The helmet flares as it goes from the top of the head down to the
neck. This helmet is more ornate than the majority of other headgear in
the game. It features an insignia and metal crest that rise well above
the helmet. A Mempo (facial armor) made of several independent metal
pieces resemble a face, a feature of traditional Japanese helmets.
Finally, on the back there is faded paint of what looks like a
mirrored-image of a creature.

## Trivia

- 90% is the max cut resistance a single item can have. If this wasn't
  the case Samurai Helmet would have an insane 103% Cut resistance at
  Masterwork quality.
  - In a previous version of Kenshi if an item had over 100% in a
    resistance taking damage of that type would heal you instead of
    damage you. It can be assumed that this is why the 90% max
    resistance limit was put into place.

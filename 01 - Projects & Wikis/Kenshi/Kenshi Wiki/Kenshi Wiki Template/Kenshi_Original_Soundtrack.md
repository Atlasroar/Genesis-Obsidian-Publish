<strong>NOTES ABOUT THE SOUNDTRACK</strong>

The music system in Kenshi has been designed in such a way, that as you
play through the game the engine randomly selects from a handful of
different musical elements to create new compositional excerpts. It is
this ambient approach and "non-player interactivity" of the music that
reinforces Kenshi's indifferent tone. Obviously for a traditional
Soundtrack release we can not recreate the randomization of this music
system (yet). However, we can get close and musically sculpt each track
with wide brushstrokes to capture the same feeling.

In addition to the gameplay music, the Kenshi Original Soundtrack
features the Main Title and a few other traditional recordings that can
be heard throughout the game. Put on a good set of headphones and let
the music transport you to the windy dunes, overgrown swamps, and
unexplored wilderness of Kenshi. Thank you and I hope you enjoy!

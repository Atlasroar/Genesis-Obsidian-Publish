**Iron Valleys** is an area located north of the
[Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink"). Much like the
[Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink"), Iron Valleys acts like a
environmental barrier because of constant Acid Rain plaguing the area.
The area is made harder to traverse because of the rocky valleys its
named for, but there are some bridges connecting the top portions making
it a little easier. The area is also patrolled by [](Iron_Spider.md).

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") in the Iron Valleys.
This zone does not spawn [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps.

### Minor Outposts

*These locations are typically small towns, villages, or faction bases.*

- [Okran's Shield](Okran's_Shield.md "wikilink")
- [Narko's Trap](Narko's_Trap.md "wikilink")

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Lost Armoury](Lost_Armoury.md "wikilink")

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

- [Iron Spider](Iron_Spider.md "wikilink")
- [Skeleton Drifter](Skeleton_Drifter.md "wikilink") ([](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) and
  [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink"))
- [Broken Skeleton](Broken_Skeleton.md "wikilink")
- [Black Desert Ninjas](Black_Desert_Ninjas.md "wikilink")

## Environment

The water here is acidic so [Human](Human.md "wikilink"),
[Shek](Shek.md "wikilink"), and most animal characters will be harmed if
they attempt to swim. The ground here is 50% acidic, meaning that
characters which are not immune to acid and are not wearing shoes will
be hurt, but it will not be as severe as in other locations with acidic
ground.

### Weather

*This zone has the 'deadlands' season. Seasons may cause harmful
[Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") or be purely aesthetic.*

- Heavy rain deadlands

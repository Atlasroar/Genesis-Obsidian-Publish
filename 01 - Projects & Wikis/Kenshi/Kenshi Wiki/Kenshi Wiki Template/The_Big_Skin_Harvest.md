**The Big Skin Harvest** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can
trigger if the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 7,000 meters of a
[Skin Bandits](Skin_Bandits.md "wikilink") owned location, or as a result
of defeating the [Skin Harvest](Skin_Harvest.md "wikilink") event. It has a
5% chance to trigger if within 3,000 meters, this chance scales down
with distance until it reaches 0% at 7,000 meters. It cannot trigger if
the player has killed or captured [Savant](Savant.md "wikilink"), or if the
player has allied with the [Skin Bandits](Skin_Bandits.md "wikilink").

Once the conditions have been fulfilled, the [](Skin_Bandits.md) will send an assault to the player's
base. This assault will consist of 2-5 squads, each made up of 8-20
[Skin Bandits](Skin_Bandit.md "wikilink").
![](Skin_Harvest_Range.jpg "Skin_Harvest_Range.jpg") When the assault
arrives, the War Leader will give a short speech asking the player to
share skins and/or food before they start the assault, attacking gates
and characters, and kidnapping fallen characters to bring them to a
[Skinhouse](Skinhouse.md "wikilink") or the [](Skinhouse_HQ.md). Captured characters will be quickly placed
into a [Peeler Machine](Peeler_Machine.md "wikilink") once there, and die
shortly after, so rescue attempts must be very swift if they wish to
save any kidnapped characters.

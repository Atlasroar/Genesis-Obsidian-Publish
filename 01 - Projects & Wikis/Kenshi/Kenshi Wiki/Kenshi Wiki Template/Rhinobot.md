**Rhinobot** is a [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") who was a notable
member of the (now defunct) [Second Empire](Second_Empire.md "wikilink").
He can be found in [Ashland Dome II](Ashland_Dome_II.md "wikilink")
alongside 7 or 8 [Screamer Units](Screamer_Unit.md "wikilink"). He carries
a [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") Topper.

Due to a lack of moral processing, Rhinobot was at one point heavily
involved with child prisons under the Second Empire, although his exact
role is unclear.

## Trivia

- Rhinobot is the only high-ranking officer of the **Second Empire** to
  have a [P4 Unit](P4_Unit.md "wikilink") model instead of a [](Skeleton_P4MkII.md) model.

**Weak Thralls**are the weakest members of the faction [](Thrall_Masters.md). There are ten Weak Thralls in the
[Tower of Abuse](Tower_of_Abuse.md "wikilink"). They can also be found in
squads roaming [The Eye](The_Eye.md "wikilink"), [Venge](Venge.md "wikilink")
and the [Grey Desert](Grey_Desert.md "wikilink"). These squads can contain
2 to 22 Weak Thralls.

## Tips

- if recruited with a mod, or if they are in a situation that requires
  use of certain skills, their lack of a head counts as an injury.

**Pearl Cups** can be found in Residential Buildings or in Hive village
shops. When starting out, stealing this item along with other junk can
help players increase their [Thievery](Thievery.md "wikilink") stat with
little risk (if the building is empty) and reward.

It is quite possible that this item is made from [](Leviathan_Pearl.md), alongside other pearl-related
things such as [Pearl Vase](Pearl_Vase.md "wikilink"), [](Pearl_Sword_Holder.md) and [](Pearl_Urn.md).

This [item](Items.md "wikilink") is also used to build a [](Thief_Training_Boxes.md). As many other Pearl items, it
can be bought from the [Hive Trader](Hive_Trader.md "wikilink") in Hive
villages.

## Trivia

- Tin Can has the highest penalty to Melee attack which makes it the
  best helmet to wear when training it.
  - It also lacks any Duststorm protection allowing for even faster
    training in one.
- Tin Can has the largest Harpoon Resistance of any piece of Armour in
  Kenshi. Only a Masterwork quality [](Eagle's_Cross.md) shot from the max height (+50%
  damage) could get through the Resistance. And even then, the cut
  damage taken would be very minor.
  - As a tradeoff it has the lowest Cut Efficiency of the \[Metal
    Plate\] Helmets with 100% Head Coverage, meaning that 35% of the
    harpoon damage it mitigates will be turned into Stun damage.
- 90% is the max cut resistance a single item can have. If this wasn't
  the case the Tin Can would have a massive 95% Cut resistance at
  Masterwork quality.

**The Crater** is a Zone in the southwestern corner of the map. The
place is filled with [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") feasting upon
packs of [Swamp Raptors](Swamp_Raptor.md "wikilink"). It is a very hostile
environment and most of the ruins are empty.

Because of shape of the crater, with high borders on all sides, it can
be difficult to pathfind to enter and exit this Zone.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") or [](Minor_Outposts.md) in The Crater. This zone does not
spawn Camps.

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink")
- [Lab Ruin](Lab_Ruin.md "wikilink")

#### Aesthetic Ruins

*These locations show up on the map, although the player cannot interact
with anything at this location.*

- [Empty Lab](Empty_Lab.md "wikilink") x3

### Nests

[*Nests*](Nest.md "wikilink")*are temporary locations which can spawn
randomly and typically belong to [Animals](Fauna.md "wikilink").*

- [Nest of Beak Things](Nest_of_Beak_Things.md "wikilink")

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

- [Beak Thing](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink")
- [Swamp Raptor](Swamp_Raptor.md "wikilink")

## Environment

### Weather

*This zone has the 'wetlands south' season. Seasons may cause harmful
[Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") or be purely aesthetic.*

- Heavy Rain
- Light rain
- Swamp rain no wind
- Clear nothing

## Tips

There are a lot of 'Beak Things' there so bring characters with high
athletics, or if you're trying to actually fight them (you absolute mad
man) a high defense character with a saber or polearm.

## Trivia

- Given the location of this zone overlapping with their neighboring
  zone, and the Skeleton's dialogue when entering this zone which
  suggests that this wasn't the appearance back then, this may formerly
  resemble something similar to [The Grid](The_Grid.md "wikilink") before a
  great explosion or explosion-like impact in the center caused it to
  become a "crater".
  - A former description of [Cat-Lon's CPU](CPU_of_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink")
    directly states this as a fact with the following line "Science and
    archaeology flourished in the empire until an explosion in the Grid
    caused a famine.". However, given the fact that the description is
    replaced, it can no longer be used to support this theory, and it
    becomes unclear whether such a theory is still valid or not.

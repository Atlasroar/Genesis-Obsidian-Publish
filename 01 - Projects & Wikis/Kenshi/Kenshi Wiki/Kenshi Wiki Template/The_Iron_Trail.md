[The Iron Trail](The_Iron_Trail.md "wikilink") is a narrow flatland with
sparse vegetation leading from the [](Cannibal_Plains.md) to the east and all the way to the
western sea. Numerous inactive and active [](Iron_Spider.md) will be seen along its sapphire colored
glassy ground up until an island on the tip of the trail.

Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

## Environment

The Iron Trail has fertility of up to 75% but water for well
construction is scarce and there are raw mineral resources within the
vicinity.

The Iron Trail is full of passive iron spiders and there isn't other
fauna that can be farmed for sustenance, although garru might stumble
upon the region and be attacked by iron spiders. Farming is still
primarily recommended as it can be a rare occurence.

### Weather

*This zone has the 'coastal' season. Seasons may cause harmful [](Weather_Effects.md) or be purely aesthetic.*

- Acid Rain
- Heavy Rain

## Tips

- The Iron Trail island can be a good location for an isolated base, far
  from many civilization centers.
- The isolated base can greatly benefit from [](Light_Wind_Generator_Theory_(Tech).md) as the iron
  spiders drop electronic components upon being defeated/killed,
  creating a straightforward path towards acquiring electrical power far
  from civilization.

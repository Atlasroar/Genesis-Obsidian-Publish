![](HydraulicKnight.png "HydraulicKnight.png") with the Ancient Samurai
Armour and [](Ancient_Samurai_Legplates.md)\|link=Special:FilePath/HydraulicKnight.png\]\]The**Ancient
Samurai Armour** is a Heavy Armour that is equipped in the Body Armour
slot. Due to its age, it has less resistances compared to its [](Samurai_Armour.md) while having the same attack damage
penalty, making this armour an inferior choice.

It is worn as a part of a set together with [](Ancient_Samurai_Legplates.md). [](Ancient_Samurai_Helmet.md) and [](Ancient_Samurai_Boots.md) could have been part of this
set, but they do not spawn in game.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **4x6**.

## Appearance

**Ancient Samurai Armour** looks like normal Samurai Armour that is
completely covered in rust. The markings on the breastplate found on
modern Samurai Armour are completely gone or had never existed in the
first place.

## Short answer

When you start as [The Freedom Seekers](Game_Starts.md "wikilink"), you
have [Gohan](Gohan.md "wikilink"), [](Building_Materials.md), [](Iron_Plates.md), [Blueprint](Blueprints.md "wikilink") for
[Wheatstraw Farming](Wheatstraw_Farming_(Tech).md "wikilink")
[Technology](Technology.md "wikilink") and some
[Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink"). And such, you can immediately go to
[Okran's Pride](Okran's_Pride.md "wikilink") to start as farmers. But if
you prefer to play with non human characters such as
[Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") and [Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink"), then [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) territory is no go.

Instead, you can go and make base south or northwest of
[Squin](Squin.md "wikilink"). [Wheat Farms](Wheat_Farm.md "wikilink") in Arid
[Environment](Environment.md "wikilink") has only 60% crops Yield, while
[Cactus Farm](Cactus_Farm.md "wikilink") - 100% (tech research is needed).

So, what is better to farm, considering ALL things related to
[Food](Food.md "wikilink") production? [Chewsticks](Chewsticks.md "wikilink")
that are made from [Cactus](Cactus.md "wikilink") or
[Bread](Bread.md "wikilink") that is made from the ingredient
[Strawflour](Strawflour.md "wikilink") which then comes from the raw
material Wheatstraw?

Short answer - Wheatstraw Farming is better.

## Long answer

In-game measurements and FCS ([](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md)) numbers check for
theoretical calculations show that even in Arid Environment (with 60%
crops Yield) Wheatstraw farming is better than Cactus farming (with 100%
crops Yield).

All the estimates are based on how many
[man-hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-hour) are spent on
production in return for Nutrition (for food), Sell value, or fueled
Power generation (for bio [Fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink")), depending on
Environment, Game stage (Skill level and Tech), including man-hours for
Fuel production (Hemp&Generator@Power=100 Load=100%) for fueled Power
generation in The Swamp. Man-hours for item delivery and production
hauling in all calculations were EXCLUDED (unskilled additional workers
were assigned as haulers).

### Game stage

In calculation tables, Game stage refers to Skill level and Technology
progress, that have impact on Food/drugs/fuel production. They are:

- Game stage 0: Related Skills =0; Farming skill crops Yield =50%

Beginning. We have no any levels in related Skills nor automatic Water
Well or Automatic Grain Silo. Even Farming skill level =0 gives penalty
to crops Yield, reducing amount of harvested crops. Each task takes 2
times more man-hours.

- Game stage 1: Related Skills =34; Farming skill crops Yield =100%

Upon reaching this Skills level, there is no more additional penalty to
crops Yield. Everything is done slightly faster.

- Game stage 2: +automatic Well

We got Technology for automatic (powered) Water Well. Yay! No more
manual Water pumping.

- Game stage 3: Related Skills =55

At this Skill level; all things are done at basic speed.

- Game stage 4: +Automatic Grain Silo

We got Technology for Automatic Grain Silo. No more manual Strawflour
milling. Wow! Now if we add Hydroponics, then 1 farmer would be able to
feed horde!

- Game stage 5: Skills =100.

This Skill level is hardly reachable. Ultimate pinnacle.

To explain the whole calculation, it is necessary to explain how the
individual things work.

## Skills work rate

[Skills](Statistics.md "wikilink") mainly affect skill-related work rate.

At 0 Skill, work rate is =0.5, meaning that to do something, character
takes 1/0.5=2x more man-hours.

At 100 Skill, work rate is =1.4, meaning that to do something, character
takes 1/1.4=0.714x less man-hours.

The formula, that fits this pattern is:
$workrate=0.5+0.9*\left ( \frac{Skill}{100} \right )$

Therefore, to have work rate exactly =1, Skill level should be = 55.555.

As example (in scope if this article), [Cooking](Cooking.md "wikilink")
skill affects work rate for making:

- [Food](Food.md "wikilink") at [Cooking Stove](Cooking_Stove.md "wikilink"),
  Cooking Stove uses 2 Power when in use;
- [Grog](Grog.md "wikilink") at [Grog Machine](Grog_Machine.md "wikilink"),
  Grog Machine uses 10 Power when in use;

  Still uses 10 Power when in use;
- [Cactus Rum](Cactus_Rum.md "wikilink") at [](Rum_Still.md), Rum Still uses 10 Power when in use;

[Labouring](Labouring.md "wikilink") skill affects work rate for:

- [Water](Water.md "wikilink") pumping at manual [Well](Well.md "wikilink"),
  t2 powered Well uses 8 Power continuously, t3 powered Well uses 10
  Power continuously;
- [Fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink") making at [](Biofuel_Distillery.md).

[Science](Science.md "wikilink") skill affects work rate for
[Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink") production at [](Hemp_Processor.md), Hemp Processor uses 20 Power when
in use.

[Farming](Farming.md "wikilink") skill affects work rate for
[Strawflour](Strawflour.md "wikilink") milling at manual [](Grain_Silo.md), Automatic Grain Silo uses 20 Power
continuously.

Farming skill also affects speed for farms crop gathering, but due to
the need for character to walk in the farm's premises to gather
(harvest) crops, ratio for time spent is not exactly the same as for
other skills.

## Farms

At Farming skill =0, skill crop Yield is =50%, meaning that, if you
farming Wheatstraw in Arid Environment that in itself gives 60%
Wheatstraw crop Yield, on average, crop Yield will be 0.5\*0.6=0.3, or
30%. At Farming skill =34, skill crop Yield will gradually reach 100%,
meaning that average crop Yield for Arid Wheatstraw will be =60%.

Besides Environment influence on crop Yield, there is also Fertility,
that translates into crops growth rate. It is possible to place farms in
locations with "dead" soil (Fertility =~1%), but this will affect growth
rate only slightly. For [Hemp Farms](Hemp_Farm.md "wikilink"), growth rate
will drop from 100% to 85%, meaning that to fully grow, crops will take
1/0.85=1.176=+17.6% more time. For all other crops, at worst possible
case (Fertility =~1%), growth rate will drop from 100% to 75%, meaning
that crops would need 1/0.75=1.33=+33% more time to fully grow. In all
calculations it was assumed that growth rate is =100%.

[Hydroponics](Hydroponics.md "wikilink") are not affected by the
environment.

Each farm has different amount of plants and crops per plot and basic
growth time and [Water](Water.md "wikilink") requirement per day. Gathering
(harvest) times were measured in-game for each farm type for 1 worker at
Farming skill =0 (MaxTime) and Farming skill =100 (MinTime), and values
in between are calculated by linear Farming skill progression formula:

$EstimatedGatherTime = MinTime+(MaxTime-MinTime)*\left (1- \frac{Skill}{100} \right )$

Largest Farms

To calculate Crops harvest per day (@Yield=100%; @Farming=55), we using
formula:

$CropsHarvestPerDay=\left ( \frac{Crops*TotalYield}{GrowthTime(100%GrowthRate)+EstimatedGatherTime} \right )*1440$

1440 is the amount of minutes in 24 hours in one day, as other time
units are in minutes.

For Cactus Farm, it will be:

$CropsHarvestPerDay=\left ( \frac{64*100%}{1728+475} \right )*1440=41.83$

Same goes for Hydroponics, except that they are unaffected by
Environment Yield or Fertility/Growth rate.

So, if we have Farming skill =55 and build 3 Wheat Farm XL, then we
would be able to harvest 220.5 crops per day (=3\*73.5), using 18.75
man-hours.$ManHours=3(Farms)*\left ( \frac{375(EstimatedGatherTimeFarming55, m)}{60(MinutesInAnHour)} \right )=18.75h$

Or, it is possible to say that in this case, excluding anything else,
production of 220.5/18.75=11.76 Wheatstraw is worth 1 man-hour.

## Production time

For all Food made at Cooking Stove (it uses Cooking skill), basic craft
time is =1 in-game hour. That means that Cooking skill =0 worker would
be able to cook 24\*0.5=12 dishes per day or 24\*1.4=33.6 dishes per day
at Cooking skill =100.

To make Bread, Coking Stove is not used. Instead the first step is to
make Strawflour from Wheatstraw at [Grain Silo](Grain_Silo.md "wikilink"),
and then Strawflour is placed into a [Bread Oven](Bread_Oven.md "wikilink")
with Water, where Bread is baked without character and Skill
involvement. Said Bread Oven will bake 24 Bread per day.

Grain Silo basic milling time for Strawflour is 20 in-game minutes, or
1/3 hour. For work rate, it uses Farming skill instead of Cooking skill.

[Automatic Grain Silo](Automatic_Flour_Grinding_(Tech).md "wikilink") works
at 100% work rate and reduces total man-hours spent on production by
removing man-hours needed for Strawflour production.

This gives ratio: 720 Wheatstraw per day : 1 Grain Silo@100% : 3 Bread
Oven : 72\*0.25 Water per day : 72 Bread per day

For drugs, basic craft time is also =1 in-game hour.

## Water

Water is needed for watering farms and for food/drug cooking.

1 water [Well](Well.md "wikilink") or [](Rain_Collector.md) can produce 48 water per day at
100% total work rate. For a Rain Collector, work rate is determined by
rain intensity. In [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"), rain intensity is
95%, in [Vain](Vain.md "wikilink") - 65%. Rain also waters farms and
hydroponics at roof, removing the need for water pumping man-hours.

Water Well work rate is determined by 3 factors - Ground water level
(@Border Zone =60%, @Okran's Pride =160%), Well efficiency (t1-manual
=75%, t2-automatic powered =100%, t3 =125%) and Labouring skill work
rate, applied only for manual Well with worker. Therefore, for example,
if we use t3 Well at Okran's Pride, it will pump 48\*1.6\*1.25=96 water
per day. If we use manual Well at Border Zone, then 1 worker at
Labouring skill =0 will pump 48\*0.6\*0.75\*0.5=10.8 Water per day.

Therefore, for this case of manual Water pumping we can say that 1 Water
cost is equal to 24/10.8=~2.22 man-hours, or that 1 man-hour is equal to
10.8/24=0.45 Water.

Automatic (powered) Wells and/or Rain Collectors greatly reduces total
man-hours spent on production by removing man-hours needed for Water
pumping.

## Fueled Power generation

All in all, there are 3 environments: Arid, Green, Swamp.

The Swamp stands out due to constant rain presence and wind absence,
removing man-hours needed for Water pumping, but also making no free
"place and forget" [wind Power generation](Wind_Generator.md "wikilink").
This means that it is needed to use Generators that burns
[Fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink") that is produced at Biofuel Distillery.

There are 3 possible ways to produce Fuel - [](Biofuel_Distillery_(Greenfruit).md), [](Biofuel_Distillery_(Wheatstraw).md) or
[Biofuel Distillery (Hemp)](Biofuel_Distillery_(Hemp).md "wikilink"). It
takes 4 crops to make 1 Fuel - and besides crop farming
possibility/efficiency, main difference is a Fuel production speed.

For Biofuel Distillery (Greenfruit) and Biofuel Distillery (Wheatstraw),
basic speed production is 32 Fuel per day.

For Biofuel Distillery (Hemp) - 64 Fuel per day.

Next, there is 90% work rate for Biofuel Distillery itself and work rate
from Labouring skill.

All that gives that 1 Worker at Labouring skill =0 (work rate =0.5) can
produce 32\*0.9\*0.5=14.4 Fuel per day from Wheatstraw/Greenfruit crops,
or 64\*0.9\*0.5=28.8 Fuel per day from Hemp crops. At Labouring skill
=100, it will be 40.32 and 80.64 Fuel per day respectively.

There are 2 types of fueled generators:

[Small Generator](Small_Generator.md "wikilink") - gives basic Power =40 at
100% load/fuel consumption;

[Generator II](Generator_II.md "wikilink") - gives 100 Power at 100%
load/fuel consumption.

They will throttle down if there is reduced power consumption - although
not very precisely.

There also [](Upgraded_Small_Generators_(Tech).md) and [](Amplified_Generators_(Tech).md) that
increases their Power output up to 70 and 130 respectively. Fuel
consumption throttle in this case is applied incorrectly, as if there is
no any bonuses for power production.

Regardless of these bonuses or a generator types usage, at 100% Power
load/Fuel consumption rate, each generator will burn 1 unit of Fuel
within ~220 in-game minutes, or ~6.55 Fuel per day. Therefore, by
producing 1 Fuel and using generators with power output =100, it
possible to say that we producing 100/6.55=~15.27 fueled Power per hour
per 1 Fuel. Dividing this number by total man-hours spent on making Fuel
(and accounting for power used to produce this fuel/power), we can
estimate fueled Power cost in man-hour units.

As example: Worker with 34 Labouring skill (work rate =
0.5+0.9\*34/100=0.806) works non stop at Biofuel Distillery (Hemp) with
sufficient supply of Hemp, each day (24 hours or 1440 minutes) producing
64\*0.9\*0.806=46.42 Fuel, that is burned at rate 6.55 Fuel per day per
Generator (46.42/6.55=~7.08 Generators), each Generator is outputting
130 power. Then it is possible to say that this worker produces
7.08\*130=920.4 fueled Power per day, or that 1 man-hour is equal to
920.4/24=38.35 fueled Power (ignoring **in this example** man-hours used
for hemp Farm production and Water pumping).

## Hunger or how much do they eat?

In FCS, there is a parameter "starvation time =60", which shows how many
hours must pass for Hunger bar to be reduced by 100 points at 1.0 Hunger
rate.

This means, that per day, characters eat 100/60\*24=40 Nutrition at 1.0
Hunger Rate.

title="Nutrition_per_day_at_Hunger_rate_=1.0.png" />
<figcaption>Nutrition_per_day_at_Hunger_rate_=1.0.png</figcaption>
</figure>

Besides [racial](Races.md "wikilink") Hunger rate, there are also
additional Hunger rate multipliers for character states:

- Idle - x0.8;
- Encumbered - in effect only when character is moving; x1.35 at 50%
  encumbrance; x1.7 at 100% encumbrance;

<figure>
<img src="Encumbrance_Hunger_rate_multiplier.png"
title="Encumbrance_Hunger_rate_multiplier.png" />
<figcaption>Encumbrance_Hunger_rate_multiplier.png</figcaption>
</figure>

- Sitting - x0.66 (Stool; Sitting Box - can be build outside) or x0.75
  (Sitting Pillow);
- Sleeping/KO - x0.33;
- Mining/using machinery - x1.2; various other.

Tip: to reduce Food consumption, it is advisable to build Stools
(interior) and/or Sitting Boxes (interior/exterior) near work places and
check AI parameter "Sit when idle".

<figure>
<img src="AI_settings.png" title="AI_settings.png" />

To be able to build Stool and Sitting Box, player must obtain and use
blueprint "Basic furniture".

### Food's hidden nutrition

When character eats Food, Hunger bar is not immediately raised by the
amount of eaten Nutrition. It takes some time for eaten Nutrition to be
"absorbed". During this "Hunger bar rise" time, character is unaffected
by the expected usual Hunger/Nutrition depletion.

FCS parameter "fed recovery rate mult =3" determines how fast eaten Food
is fully "absorbed".
![](FCS_parameter_"fed_recovery_rate_mult".png "FCS_parameter_"fed_recovery_rate_mult".png")

It actually refers to the character's racial Hunger rate. Character with
racial Hunger rate =0.5 depletes 100/60\*0.5=0.833 Hunger per hour and
recovers 0.833\*3=2.5 Hunger per hour when it eats Food. This means that
to "absorb" 50 Nutrition, this character will take 50/2.5=20 hours,
during which its usual Hunger is "freezes". This means that, if during
this time this character had some activity resulting in final (with
character state multipliers) Hunger rate =0.5, it saved 20\*0.833=16.66
Nutrition, effectively meaning that it eaten 50+16.66=66.66 Nutrition or
66.66/50=1.33 =+33% more Nutrition than it is expected.

If we take character with racial Hunger rate =1.25, then it depletes
100/60\*1.25=2.08 Hunger per hour and recovers 2.08\*3=6.25 Hunger per
hour when it eats Food. This means that to "absorb" 50 Nutrition, this
character will take 50/6.25=8 hours, during which its usual Hunger is
"freezes". This means that, if during this time this character had some
activity resulting in final (with character state multipliers) Hunger
rate =1.25, it saved 8\*2.08=16.66 Nutrition, effectively meaning that
it eaten 50+16.66=66.66 Nutrition or 66.66/50=1.33 =+33% more Nutrition
than it is expected. If character had activity (during Hunger bar rise)
resulting in final (with character state multipliers, for example 100%
Encumbered) Hunger rate=1.25x1.7=2.125, it saved 8\*100/60\*2.125=28.33
Nutrition, effectively meaning that it eaten 50+28.33=78.33 Nutrition or
78.33/50=1.567 =+56.7% more Nutrition than it is expected.

All this means that Food will last a little longer and it is possible to
aim for lower required amount of nutrition per day to feed characters.
The more characters average daily Hunger rate modifier (Sleeping x0.33
-\> 100% Encumbered x1.7), the lesser the coefficient for required
Nutrition per day.

Example: We have 10 characters that eat 10\*N Nutrition per day at
average daily Hunger rate modifier =1.0. If they sleep, then average
daily Hunger rate modifier =0.33, therefore expecting that we would
require 10\*N\*0.33=3.3\*N Nutrition per day. But at average daily
Hunger rate modifier =0.33 we should also apply coefficient =0.9,
resulting in 10\*N\*0.33\*0.9=2.97\*N required Nutrition per day.

If these 10 characters are in 100% Encumbered state, then their average
daily Hunger rate modifier =1.7, and it is expected that they would eat
10\*N\*1.7=17\*N Nutrition per day. But due to unexpected behavior
("Hunger bar rise -\> freeze nutrition depletion"), we can apply
coefficient =0.638, resulting in 10\*N\*1.7\*0.638=10.846\*N required
Nutrition per day.

|------------------------------------|----------|-------|----------|-------------------|
| Character's state                  | Sleeping | Idle  | Not idle | 100% Encumberance |
| Average daily Hunger rate modifier | 33%      | 80%   | 100%     | 170%              |
| Coefficient                        | 0.900    | 0.789 | 0.750    | 0.638             |
| Real "daily Hunger rate modifier"  | 30.0%    | 63.2% | 75.0%    | 108.5%            |

These coefficients are not depended on racial hunger rate and
calculation example is following.

Let's take character with racial hunger rate =1 that is sleeping (has
33% Hunger rate modifier). Its Hunger bar reached 250 mark, so that
character eaten 50 Nutrition. To "absorb" these 50 Nutrition, character
will take 50/(100/60\*1\*3)=10 hours. After this amount of time, Hunger
bar reaches 250+50=300 mark and start to decrease. To reach 250 mark
again, character will spend 50/(100/60\*1\*0.33)=90 hours. So, total
time passed is 10+90=100 hours, out of which only 90 hours the character
was actually depleting its Hunger bar, or 90/(90+10) =0.9 of all the
time.

Let's take character with racial hunger rate =1.25 that is 100%
Encumbered (has 170% Hunger rate modifier). Its Hunger bar reached 250
mark, so that character eaten 20 Nutrition. To "absorb" these 20
Nutrition, character will take 20/(100/60\*1.25\*3)=3.2 hours. After
this amount of time, Hunger bar reaches 250+20=270 mark and start to
decrease. To reach 250 mark again, character will spend
20/(100/60\*1.25\*1.7)=~5.647 hours. So, total time passed is
3.2+5.647=8.847 hours, out of which only 5.647 hours the character was
actually depleting its Hunger bar, or 5.647/(3.2+5.647) =0.638 of all
the time.

## Example calculations

Let's assume that we have 6 characters with Hunger rate =1.0, skills
=34, and wish to settle in the Border Zone which has Arid Environment
and 60% Ground water level. We can farm Cactus with 100% crops Yield for
Chewsticks or Wheatstraw with 60% crops Yield for Bread.

### Cactus 100%

Chewsticks have Nutrition =20 and Sell Value =76. To make Chewsticks, 8
Cactus and 1 Water are needed. To feed 6 characters with Hunger rate
=1.0 every day, we would require 6\*40\*1/20=12 Chewsticks per day. To
cook 12 Chewsticks per day, we would require 12\*8=96 Cactus and
12\*1=12 Water per day.

Cactus Farm XL (64x1) requires 2 Water per day. Cactus Farm crops Growth
time =28.8 hours (~1728 minutes)(@Growth Rate =100%). After crops grew
up, Farmer must harvest crops, and this also takes some time that must
be accounted for. This Gathering (harvesting) time is calculated by
using formula:

$EstimatedGatherTime = MinTime+(MaxTime-MinTime)*\left (1- \frac{Skill}{100} \right )$,
where MinTime and MaxTime are values for Cactus Farm XL (64x1), taken
from tables, mentioned earlier in the article.

Estimated Gather Time for Cactus Farm XL (64x1) at Farming skill level
=34 is:

$EstimatedGatherTime = 268+(728-268)*\left (1- \frac{34}{100} \right )=571.6$minutes,
or 571.6/60=~9.53 hours.

To calculate average crops harvest per day, following formula is used:

$CropsHarvestPerDay=\left ( \frac{Crops*TotalYield}{GrowthTime(100%GrowthRate)+EstimatedGatherTime} \right )*1440$

Cactus harvest per day for Cactus Farm XL (64x1) at Farming skill level
=34 is:

$CropsHarvestPerDay=\left ( \frac{64*100%}{1728+571.6} \right )*1440=40.08$Cactus
per day per Cactus Farm XL (64x1).

Therefore, to produce 96 Cactus per day, we need 96/40.08=2.40 Cactus
Farm XL (64x1), that is rounded up to 3.

To harvest crops from 3 Cactus Farm XL (64x1), 3\*9.53=28.58
man-hours are needed (28.58/24=1.19 Farmers per day).

3 Cactus Farm XL (64x1) would be giving 3\*40.08=120.23 Cactus per day,
enough to Cook 120.23/8=15.03 Chewsticks per day, using
15.03/0.806=18.65 man-hours on Chewsticks Cooking Stoves (# of Cooking
Stoves/cooks =18.65/24=0.78 per day).

Total Water per day required is =3(farms)\*2(water per day per
farm)+15.03(cooked Chewsticks per day)\*0.25(water per cooked
Chewsticks)=21.03.

Manual water Well with Labouring =34 worker placed at 60% Ground water
level would pump 48\*0.75\*0.6\*0.806=17.40 Water per day (per 24
hours). Therefore, to pump 21.03 Water per day, 21.03/17.40\*24=28.99
man-hours are needed (# of manual Well/workers =28.99/24=1.21 per day).

Total man-hours spent on production =28.58(man-hours on farms)
+18.65(man-hours on cooking Chewsticks) +28.99(man-hours on Water
pumping) =76.22 (Non stop workers =76.22/24=3.18).

Total Nutrition =15.03(Cooked Chewsticks)\*20(Chewsticks
Nutrition)=300.57.

Nutrition per man-hour =300.57(Total Nutrition)/76.22(Total
man-hours)=3.94.

Total Sell value =15.03(Cooked Chewsticks)\*76(Chewsticks Sell
value)=1142.18.

Value per man-hour =1142.18(Total Sell value)/76.22(Total
man-hours)=14.99.

### Wheatstraw 60%

Bread has Nutrition =30 and Sell Value =244. To make Bread, 10
Wheatstraw and 0.25 Water are needed. To feed 6 characters with Hunger
rate =1.0 every day, we would require 6\*40\*1/30=8 Bread per day. To
cook 8 Bread per day, we would require 8\*10=80 Wheatstraw and 8\*0.25=2
Water per day.

Wheat Farm XL (100x1) requires 5 Water per day. Wheat Farm crops Growth
time =26.4 hours (~1584 minutes)(@Growth Rate =100%). After crops grew
up, Farmer must harvest crops, and this also takes some time that must
be accounted for. This Gathering (harvesting) time is calculated by
using formula:

$EstimatedGatherTime = MinTime+(MaxTime-MinTime)*\left (1- \frac{Skill}{100} \right )$,
where MinTime and MaxTime are values for Wheat Farm XL (100x1), taken
from tables, mentioned earlier in the article.

Estimated Gather Time for Wheat Farm XL (100x1) at Farming skill level
=34 is:

$EstimatedGatherTime = 215+(571-215)*\left (1- \frac{34}{100} \right )=445$minutes,
or 445/60=~7.5 hours.

To calculate average crops harvest per day, following formula is used:

$CropsHarvestPerDay=\left ( \frac{Crops*TotalYield}{GrowthTime(100%GrowthRate)+EstimatedGatherTime} \right )*1440$

Wheatstraw harvest per day for Wheat Farm XL (100x1) at Farming skill
level =34 is:

$CropsHarvestPerDay=\left ( \frac{100*60%}{1584+445} \right )*1440=42.58$Wheatstraw
per day per Wheat Farm XL (100x1).

Therefore, to produce 80 Wheatstraw per day, we need 80/42.58=1.87 Wheat
Farm XL (100x1), that is rounded up to 2.

To harvest crops from 2 Wheat Farm XL (100x1), 2\*7.5=15 man-hours are
needed (15/24=0.625 Farmers per day).

2 Wheat Farm XL (100x1) would be giving 2\*42.58=85.16 Wheatstraw per
day, enough to mill 85.16/10=8.516 Strawflour per day, using
8.516/3/0.806=3.52 man-hours on manual Grain Silo (# of manual Grain
Silo =3.52/24=0.146 per day).

Total Water per day required is =2(farms)\*5(water per day per
farm)+8.516(baked Bread per day)\*0.25(water per baked Bread)=12.12.

Manual water Well with Labouring =34 worker placed at 60% Ground water
level would pump 48\*0.75\*0.6\*0.806=17.40 Water per day (per 24
hours). Therefore, to pump 12.12 Water per day, 12.12/17.40\*24=16.71
man-hours are needed (# of manual Well/workers =16.71/24=0.7 per day).

Total man-hours spent on production =15(man-hours on farms)
+3.52(man-hours on manual Grain Silo) +16.71(man-hours on Water pumping)
=35.23 (Non stop workers =35.23/24=1.467).

Total Nutrition = 8.516(baked Bread)\*30(Bread Nutrition) =255.48.

Nutrition per man-hour =255.48(Total Nutrition)/35.23(Total
man-hours)=7.25.

Total Sell value = 8.516(baked Bread)\*244(Bread Sell value)=2078.

Value per man-hour =2078(Total Sell value)/35.23(Total man-hours)=58.98.

### Conclusion

Comparing results, it is clear to see that even with 100% Cactus crops
Yield Chewsticks production is much more labor-intensive than Bread
production with Wheatstraw crops 60% Yield.

Chewsticks vs Bread comparison

Same calculation methodology with corresponding value changes is used to
calculate everything. For swamps, it is also accounted for man-hours
used to produce fueled Power, using Biofuel Distillery (Hemp) in
conjunction with usual Hemp Farms (if "main" production uses usual farms
= assumed absence of Hydroponic Tech) or Hydroponic Hemp (if "main"
production uses Hydroponics = assumed presence of Hydroponic Tech).

## Tips

1.  Farms can have up to 4 workers. Instead of 4 workers doing 4 Farms
    in parallel, It is advisable to assign 4 workers to do 1 Farm at a
    time so that 4 workers gather (harvest) grown crops faster (4x
    faster than 1 worker but also using 4x(1/4) time = same amount of
    man-hours) -\> but causing reduced "grow+harvest" time cycle length
    -\> increasing crops harvest per day per Farm -\> potentially
    reducing amount of Farms (and man-hours on Farms and Water pumping)
    needed to meet crops demand per day -\> increasing amount of crops
    per day for further processing -\> all in all **slightly**
    increasing production output per man-hours spent.
2.  Darkness will lower work-related skill level resulting in related to
    low skill level consequences. To reduce impact of darkness - it is
    advisable to equip character with [](Lantern_of_Radiance.md) - 2 characters standing
    close enough to each other and illuminating themselves and each
    other will fully remove darkness penalty.

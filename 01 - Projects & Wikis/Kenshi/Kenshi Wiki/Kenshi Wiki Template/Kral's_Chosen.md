**Kral's Chosen** are a group of rogue [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink"). They
often attack outsiders in the wilderness, despite the order from [](Stone_Golem.md) against it. They are led by
their leader, [Ida the Flying Bull](Flying_Bull.md "wikilink"), who was a
former loyalist and an [Invincible](The_Five_Invincibles.md "wikilink") to
the previous Shek ruler - [King Shager](King_Shager's_Reign.md "wikilink"),
who was [overthrown](Shager's_Overthrow.md "wikilink") and executed by
Esata.

While they do not like the "inferior" races, they are devout followers
of [Kral](Way_Of_The_Warrior:_The_Book_Of_Kral "wikilink") and even an
outsider can earn their respect if they can prove their strength in
combat. Sometimes, rather than attacking, they will simply insult
'flatskins' that are passing by, not considering them worth 'soiling the
blade of their sword'.

They worship the [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") hero Kral, a legendary warrior
who faced 100 swordsmen in an ambush during his final battle and was
stabbed in the back. After the first hit he kept fighting, and was dealt
100 cuts before finally going down. The book [](Kral's_Last_Stand.md) tells of this tale.

- Harming [Flying Bull](Flying_Bull.md "wikilink") will seriously damage

  under **Kral's Chosen** rule after certain World States are achieved
  and get positive relations.

## Locations

## Misc.

Dialogue from a gate guard at [New Kralia](New_Kralia.md "wikilink") after
defeating and turning in the [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"):

"So, we finally meet the so-called slayer... Maybe the gullible lackeys
of the Stone Golem lap up your lies, but I don't buy it. Think we bow to
your fake reputation, [flatskin](Flatskins.md "wikilink")? Foolishness.
Prove your glory to me with your blade, \[character name\]!"

## Trivia

- When Kral's Chosen take over towns, they uncharacteristically do not
  attack outsiders unprovoked unlike the roaming squads.
- Kral's Chosen are occassionally referred to as "Skull Collectors" in
  their dialogue within the FCS, this might be removed content that
  wasn't completely removed, causing some instances where mentions of
  Skull Collectors still pop out (like [](Green.md)).

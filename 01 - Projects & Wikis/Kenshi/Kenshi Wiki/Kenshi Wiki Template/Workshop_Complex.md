**Workshop Complex** is an [](Ancient_Locations.md) in The Grid. This complex is
comprised of three completed workshop buildings and two
uncompleted/submerged. Workshop buildings are large, hangar-like
structures. This location is one of the few reliable places to
obtainÂ [Engineering Research](Engineering_Research.md "wikilink"). Similar
locations are the [Dead Workshop](Dead_Workshop.md "wikilink"), [](Deadland_Workshop.md), and [](Post-Ancient_Workshop.md). All of them can be marked
by reading the **Engineers [Map](Maps.md "wikilink")**.

The workshop located near the icon on the map is empty, while the hangar
southwest of the icon on the map and northeast of the icon both have the
containers with item spawns. The amount of [](Ancient_Science_Book.md) and [](Engineering_Research.md) spawning is between 4-9 for
each item. The fourth workshop, located westmost along the same line,
was probably never completed and consists of the hanger shell only.
Fifth workshop, if ever completed, is now completely submerged and is
located to the south-east of the main line of workshops. There are also
several iron nodes nearby which could explain placement of the Complex
in this area.

## Dangers

The zone which is closely located to [](The_Crater.md), which is a zone with a high number of
[Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink"). Sometimes small groups wander into
the Grid.

## Item Spawns

This location's storage containers will be locked with container lock
levels ranging from levels 25 to 75.

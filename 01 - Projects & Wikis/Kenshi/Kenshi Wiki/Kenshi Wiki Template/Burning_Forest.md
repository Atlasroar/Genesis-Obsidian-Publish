The **Burning Forest** is a swampy forest filled with [](Blood_Spider.md). It has its namesake from the [](Weather_Effects.md) which commonly occurs here. The only
shelter from said rain is the Ancient Labs in the center of the Zone
which is likely to have a couple of Security Spiders.

Players passing through this area without adequate Acid protection
should consider learning the [Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink") for a
camp tent. Tents can be used as a temporary shelter from Acid Rain and
are much easier to construct than a full building. However, tents will
not provide safety from [Blood Spiders](Blood_Spider.md "wikilink") which
are a danger in this Zone no matter the weather.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") or [](Minor_Outposts.md) in the Burning Forest. This zone
does not spawn Camps.

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Farm Ruin](Farm_Ruin.md "wikilink")
- [Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink")

### Nests

[*Nests*](Nest.md "wikilink")*are temporary locations which can spawn
randomly and typically belong to [Animals](Fauna.md "wikilink").*

- [Swamp Raptor Nest](Swamp_Raptor_Nest.md "wikilink")

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

- [Blood Spider](Blood_Spider.md "wikilink")
- [Swamp Turtle](Swamp_Turtle.md "wikilink")

## Environment

### Weather

*This zone has two seasons. Seasons may cause harmful [](Weather_Effects.md) or be purely aesthetic.*

**United Cities Assault** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") sent by the
[United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") as a response to losing the
[Drug Bust](Drug_Bust.md "wikilink"), [](Tax_Evasion_Enforcement.md), or **United Cities
Assault** events. Except as a response to tax evasion, it cannot trigger
if [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink"), [](Lord_Inaba.md), [Lord Nagata](Lord_Nagata.md "wikilink"),
[Lord Yoshinaga](Lord_Yoshinaga.md "wikilink"), [](Lady_Sanda.md), and [Lady Tsugi](Lady_Tsugi.md "wikilink")
are all killed or captured.

Once triggered, the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") will send
an assault party. This party will consist of at least two squads, made
up of 10-20 [Samurai Conscripts](Samurai_Conscript.md "wikilink"), 2-5
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), and 1-3 [](Samurai_Scout.md), led by an additional
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"). Rarely one or more of the squads will be
substituted for a squad made up of 1-4 [](Samurai_Conscript.md), 5-8
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), and 1-3 [](Samurai_Scout.md), led by a [](Samurai_Sergeant.md).

Once the assault party arrives, the War Leader will give a short speech,
then order the assault to begin. The soldiers will then attack the
gates, attack any player characters they see, and liberate captives they
find. If the assault is defeated, it will trigger another **United
Cities Assault** event in 72-100 hours, with a 100% chance if this event
was triggered by the [Drug Bust](Drug_Bust.md "wikilink") event, and a 50%
chance if it was trigger any other way. If the player is defeated, the
assault party will retreat and return home, the [](Tax_Collector.md) event will be triggered in 12-48
hours if this event was triggered by the [](Tax_Evasion_Enforcement.md) event, otherwise no
further events will be triggered.

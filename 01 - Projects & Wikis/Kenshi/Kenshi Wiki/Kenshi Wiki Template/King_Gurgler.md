The **King Gurgler** commands the [Fishmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink") on an
island south of [Catun](Catun.md "wikilink") called [](Fishman_Island.md). He can be found in the [](Island_Lab.md) on the most south-western tip of the island.

He wields a [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") grade [](Combat_Cleaver.md) and is a deadly foe.

His [Gurgler Head](Gurgler_Head.md "wikilink") can be looted from his body
and sold to collect on his bounty. Looting the head from his unconscious
body will result in his immediate death.

**Jonin Assault** is a series of [Events](Events.md "wikilink") that can
trigger as a result of the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") killing or
capturing certain [Anti-Slavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") characters.
There are technically three variants to this event, though one cannot
trigger naturally thanks to a bug.

1.  The first variant can trigger if the player is an enemy of the
    [Anti-Slavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink"), has killed or captured
    [Bo](Bo.md "wikilink"), [Jaegar](Jaegar.md "wikilink"), and
    [Grey](Grey.md "wikilink"), while [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") is
    still alive and free. It has a 25% chance to trigger each day if
    within 7,000 meters of [Spring](Spring.md "wikilink"), which scales
    down with distance until hitting 0% chance at 15,000 meters. The
    assault party consists of 3-5 squads, each is most often made up of
    5 [Anti-Slavers](Anti-Slaver.md "wikilink") and 5 [](Anti-Slaver_(unarmed).md), or rarely 5
    [Anti-Slaver Jonins](Anti-Slaver_Jonin.md "wikilink") instead. If
    defeated, it is supposed to have a 40% to trigger the third variant
    in 72-100 hours, but this normally fails due to it requiring
    [Grey](Grey.md "wikilink") to be alive and free.
2.  The second variant triggers if the player has killed or captured
    [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink"), but [Jaegar](Jaegar.md "wikilink") is
    still alive and free. It has a 100% chance to trigger each day if
    within 8,000 meters of [Spring](Spring.md "wikilink"), this chance
    scales down with distance until hitting 0% at 20,000 meters. The
    assault party consists of 3-4 squads, each most commonly made up of
    5 [Anti-Slaver Jonins](Anti-Slaver_Jonin.md "wikilink"), but less
    commonly can have 5 [Anti-Slavers](Anti-Slaver.md "wikilink") and 5
    [Anti-Slaver (Unarmed)](Anti-Slaver_(unarmed).md "wikilink") instead,
    while it is led by [Jaegar](Jaegar.md "wikilink"). It is supposed to be
    able to be led by [Grey](Grey.md "wikilink") and [Bo](Bo.md "wikilink") as
    well, but this cannot trigger in vanilla thanks to a bug.
3.  ![](Jonin_Assault_(Enemy)_Range.jpg "Jonin_Assault_(Enemy)_Range.jpg")![](Jonin_Assault_(Tinfist)_Range.jpg "Jonin_Assault_(Tinfist)_Range.jpg")The
    third variant, which is bugged and cannot trigger normally, is
    supposed to trigger as a result of defeating the first variant, but
    as it requires [Grey](Grey.md "wikilink") to be alive and free, while
    the first variant requires him to be killed or captured it cannot
    trigger (unless the player captures him then frees him later before
    this variant is triggered). The assault party consists of 3-4
    squads, the first made up of 4 [](Anti-Slaver_(unarmed).md), 4 [](Anti-Slaver_Jonin.md),
    [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink"), and [Grey](Grey.md "wikilink"). The
    others will be most commonly made up of 5 [](Anti-Slaver_Jonin.md), but less commonly can have 5
    [Anti-Slavers](Anti-Slaver.md "wikilink") and 5 [](Anti-Slaver_(unarmed).md) instead. If defeated,
    it should have a 20% chance of triggering the 3rd variant again in
    24-72 hours, this of course still requires [Grey](Grey.md "wikilink")
    to be alive and free though.

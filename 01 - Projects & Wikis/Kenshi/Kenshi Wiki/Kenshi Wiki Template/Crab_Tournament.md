## Overview

The **Crab Tournaments** are a series of [Events](Events.md "wikilink")
involving the [Crab Raiders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink") faction. They
trigger when a [Crab Raider](Crab_Raider.md "wikilink") spots a player
character inside a [base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") owned
by the [player](Nameless.md "wikilink"), and the [](Guide_to_Faction_Relations.md) with them is less
than 50. The [Crab Queen](Crab_Queen.md "wikilink") must also still be in
power.

Over the course of the events, several raids will attack your base,
including a number of unique crabs. It is impossible to truly lose the
tournament, as it just loops on itself if you repeatedly lose the rounds
of the tournament. Achieving victory in the final round of the
tournament will result in gaining an alliance with the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md) faction.

Despite being implied to be a battle between crabs, you don't actually
need any crabs or even animals to participate. The raiders will simply
refer to your crab as the "Mystery Crab" throughout the tournament
regardless of if you have one or not.

## Variants

Once spotted by a [Crab Raider](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink") patrol, the
first event **Crab Tournament** will be triggered in 12-32 hours.

### Crab Tournament

The first round of the tournament, consisting of 8-12 [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md), 10 [Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink"), and
[Titus](Titus.md "wikilink"). If the raiders are defeated, the **Crab
Quarter Finals** event will be triggered in 72-120 hours. If the raiders
are victorious, the first round will trigger again in 72-120 hours.

### Crab Quarter Finals

The second round of the tournament, consisting of 12-15 [](Crab_Raider.md), 10 [Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink"), and
[Barnabus](Barnabus.md "wikilink"). If the raiders are defeated, the **Crab
Semi Finals** event will be triggered in 72-100 hours. If the raiders
are victorious, the **Crab Remedial Round** event will be triggered in
72-100 hours.

### Crab Semi Finals

The third round of the tournament, consisting of 14-21 [](Crab_Raider.md), 15 [Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink"), and [](Mr_Gigantus.md). If the raiders are defeated, the
**Crab Tournament Final** event will be triggered in 70-140 hours. If
the raiders are victorious, the **Crab Remedial Round** event will be
triggered in 72-120 hours.

### Crab Tournament Final

The fourth and final round of the tournament, consisting of 20-25 [](Crab_Raider.md), 15 [Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink"), and [](The_Crabinator.md). If the raiders are defeated, the
**Crab Champion** event will be triggered in 1 hour. If the raiders are
victorious, the **Crab Remedial Round** event will be triggered in
72-120 hours.

### Crab Remedial Round

A special round of the tournament, which only triggers if the player is
defeated in one of the rounds of the tournament. It consists of 8-10
[Crab Raiders](Crab_Raider.md "wikilink") and 10 [Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink").
If the raiders are defeated, the **Crab Quarter Finals** event will be
triggered again in 72-100 hours. If the raiders are victorious, the
**Crab Remedial Round** event will be triggered again in 72-100 hours.

### Crab Champion

The final event in the tournament, which consists of 8-10 [](Crab_Raider.md) and 10 [Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink"), but is
non-hostile. Once it arrives, they will give a short speech announcing
the player's "Mystery Crab" as the grand champion of the tournament,
instantly allying the player to the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md) faction. Shortly afterwards the
raiders will take their leave and return home.

## Tips and bugs

- It is possible to lower your standing with the Crab Raiders in a
  controlled way to below 50 by repeatedly and unsuccessfully attempting
  a sneak knockout on the [Crab Queen](Crab_Queen.md "wikilink"). This is
  useful if you have more then 50 reputation already but still want the
  Crab Tournament to happen. Dropping the reputation to 49 in this way
  will anger the whole throne room.
- The terrain in Crab Raider territory is rocky and uneven. This causes
  the bigger crabs to get stuck easily. It may be necessary to leave the
  base to intercept the stuck crabs in order to complete a tournament
  round successfully.
- A war party will typically spawn in at the closest [](Crab_Village.md). Building close to it may reduce the
  AI path finding troubles.
- It is possible for the Crab Tournament to trigger on NPC factions, if
  they happen to have a squad in the player's town and a Crab Raider
  patrol spots them. As the dialog only checks if they are in a player
  owned town, not if the character they see is a player.

**The Five Invincibles** are the greatest warriors of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md). They can all be found in the Faction
HQ in [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink").

One of the Five Invincibles will be leading the Shek reinforcements
during a [Holy Nationraid](Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") on an allied player's
outpost. If [Esata the Stone Golem](Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") is killed or
imprisoned then the Five Invincibles will swear allegiance to [](Flying_Bull.md) and will start to spawn as members of the
[Kral's Chosen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md "wikilink").

## Interactions

The Five Invincibles lead the most deadly and important assaults of the
Shek Kingdom against a [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md), the [](Invincible_Vengeance.md) and the [](Stone_Golem's_Revenge.md). Amusingly, the random
generation of the composition of these assaults can result in more than
5 Invincibles attacking a player's base.

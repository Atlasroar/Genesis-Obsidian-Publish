<img src="Hive_Prince.png" title="Hive_Prince.png" width="200"
alt="Hive_Prince.png" /> **Western Hive Princes** are a
[Race](Races.md "wikilink") in Kenshi. They are a subrace of the Western
[Hive](Hive.md "wikilink"). They are a playable race from the start of the
game.

Free Princes are rare, as they evolved to be more independent from the
main Hive and remain separated for long periods of time. They also do
not eat [Foul Raw Meat](Foul_Raw_Meat.md "wikilink"), unlike the other
Hiver breeds. Of all Hive breeds, they are also the most intelligent.
[Dead Hive](Deadhive_Prince.md "wikilink") and [](Southern_Hive_Prince.md) have their own version of the
Hive Prince.

## Trivia

- Though Hiveless Princes are typically found in high positions in other
  societies, it is possible to encounter them in low-ranking roles such
  as [Samurai Conscripts](Samurai_Conscript.md "wikilink") (ironically,
  sometimes the [Samurai Sergeant](Samurai_Sergeant.md "wikilink") in
  charge of them is a Worker Drone.)

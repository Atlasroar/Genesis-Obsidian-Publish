**Okran's Pride** is the symbolic region and home to the capital of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). Like many other territories
which HN control, it is named after their God [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink").

It is characterized by it's fertile grasslands, beautiful plant life,
docile climate, plentiful water and the ever-annoying swarms of [](River_Raptor.md) that are the parasites of the
paradise. Because it's one of the most fertile and stable regions in
Kenshi, taking over this zone is the ambition of many warlords from
other major factions.

Many [Holy Farms](Holy_Farms.md "wikilink") can be found in Okran's Pride,
with [Holy Farmers](Holy_Farmer.md "wikilink") working the farms and
killing the ever present [River Raptors](River_Raptor.md "wikilink"). It is
also regularly patrolled by a fairly large amount of Holy armies, who
will attempt to cull any [River Nests](River_Nest.md "wikilink") alongside
any other undesirables ([Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") and
unaccompanied non-humans) that the Holy armies see.

Okran's Pride surrounds the same river which flows through
[Wend](Wend.md "wikilink") to the north and through the [](Border_Zone.md) to the south, and likely is the major
provider for the water and precipitation of the environment. There are
small bridges around on top of the river that allows walking over.

## Tips



## Trivia

- Given that this region has a large river flowing through it and that
  [Holy Bars](Holy_Nation_Bar.md "wikilink") and
  [Bakeries](Holy_Bakery.md "wikilink") sells [](Dried_Fish.md), it's possible that this river contains
  some fish and some of the peasants catch them for their living.
- This region is often times referred to as "grasslands" by characters
  outside of HN for its vegetation that is rarely found in Kenshi
  outside of this region.

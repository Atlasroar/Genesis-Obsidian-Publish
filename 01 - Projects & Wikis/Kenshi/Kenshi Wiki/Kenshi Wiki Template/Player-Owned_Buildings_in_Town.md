Inside towns, there are often buildings for sale which can
becomeÂ **Player-Owned Buildings in Town**. Players can find out if
buildings are purchasable by clicking on them and reading their
information. To buy these buildings, simply click on the "Buy" button
and confirm in the following popup window. Once bought the player-owned
buildings in town cannot be sold.

Inside these buildings and on their roofs, you can build any interior
type building and some labeled exterior. Having a building in town
before building an outpost is great in the early-game because Town
Guards will protect against [Events](Events.md "wikilink"). These buildings
can be a safe haven for [Technology](Technology.md "wikilink") and
[Crafting](Crafting.md "wikilink") research.

(*To buy buildings simply click on them and click "buy". Please keep in
mind that not all buildings are for sale.*)

## Things to Consider

### Local Factions and Resources

If players are planning on starting up a mining operation, they should
make sure that there's a good supply of [Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink")
and/or [Copper](Copper.md "wikilink") nearby.

If players intend on using the building for research, they should make
sure that they have enough [](Research_Artifacts.md) or that there is a place
nearby to collect more.

### Wind Speeds

If the building purchased has an accessible roof, players can build a
[Small Wind Generator](Small_Wind_Generator.md "wikilink") on that roof.
This is an additional source of [Power](Power.md "wikilink").
[Prospecting](Prospecting.md "wikilink") beforehand is essential as some
[Zones](:Category:Zones "wikilink") do not have seasons which include
wind.

If there isn't wind, players can build a [](Small_Generator.md) and use [Fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink").
This can be costly, although through
[Hydroponics](Hydroponics.md "wikilink") and a [](Biofuel_Distillery.md), players can create all the
fuel they need.

There are some Towns which are not creating enough
[Power](Power.md "wikilink") to meet the demands of their inhabitants. If
this occurs, the town will actually siphon off any power which your
buildings create.

### Building Type

Sometimes buildings can hop around when you import a saved game. If you
want a *specific*building in town, you can hop into the [](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md) and make a
building purchasable.

## After Purchasing

### Rebuilding a Ruined Building

Some buildings for sale are "ruined". This means that there's a lot of
wreckage, with very little space to place anything. Players can repair
them using [Building Materials](Building_Materials.md "wikilink").

To start the repair process, players will need to right-click-hold on
the building. In the right-click menu, pick "Repair", and all currently
selected Player Characters will begin construction. Click on the
building itself to check how many Building Materials it requires to
repair.

### Public or Private?

If a building is **Public**, guards will patrol it and citizens are free
to walk in and shop at a [Shop Counter](Shop_Counter.md "wikilink"). If a
building is **Private**, citizens can *not*enter the building and,
therefore, will *not*buy anything.

### Restrictions on Buildings

Many external buildings cannot be constructed on a roof.

### Town Overrides

Kenshi has a system of [World States](World_States.md "wikilink") which are
connected to unique characters. If certain characters are killed or
imprisoned, specific locations can be overwritten. This will effect
every single building in that location. If this happens to a town which
contains a player-owned building, everything constructed or stored
inside of the building will cease to exist.

There are some towns that are safe from [](Town_Overrides.md). These are typically the towns
controlled by the [Tech Hunters](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink") or another
minor faction: [Black Scratch](Black_Scratch.md "wikilink"),
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"), [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink"), [](Mud_Town.md), [The Hub](The_Hub.md "wikilink"), any
[Waystation](Waystation.md "wikilink"), and [](Flats_Lagoon.md).

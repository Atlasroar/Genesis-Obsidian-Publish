**Training** [buildings](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") are an easy way to
level stats without risk. Players can construct these after researching
[Training Tech](Training_Tech.md "wikilink"). Often, these buildings can be
found in barracks. Many of these buildings are found in [](Thieves_Guild.md).

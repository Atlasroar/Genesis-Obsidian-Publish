**Holy Priests** are high-ranking figures of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). They are devoted to their god
[Okran](Okran.md "wikilink") and tend to stay within or near temples.

They will lead [Prayer Days](Prayer_Day.md "wikilink") to a player's
outpost if it is located within Holy Nation territory or nearby.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction. Their Color scheme is named "Whitest" and is the same as the
Phoenix.

## Interactions

Holy Priests may tend to approach your female characters for a harmless
lecture about Okran. To avoid getting in trouble just play it cool. You
can come back when you are stronger to teach them a lesson.

As a serious religious believer to Okran, Holy Priests may regard
non-[Human](Human.md "wikilink") races as a threat and will call the
[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink") indiscriminately to have them subdued and
imprisoned. They might not call the guards if human allies are nearby.

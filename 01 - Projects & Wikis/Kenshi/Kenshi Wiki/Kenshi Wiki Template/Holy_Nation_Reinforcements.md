**Holy Nation Reinforcements** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that
will trigger in response to the [Enemy Hunt](Enemy_Hunt.md "wikilink"),
[Invincible Vengeance](Invincible_Vengeance.md "wikilink"), and [](Stone_Golem's_Revenge.md) events, as long as
the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") is allied to the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) is alive and free.

Once triggered the [Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") will send
reinforcements from the location they own closest to the player's
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"). While they will move
faster than most hostile events, they can still arrive too late if the
player's base is closer to the hostile event's spawn location than to
the origin of the reinforcements. These reinforcements will consist of
4-9 [Holy Servants](Holy_Servant.md "wikilink"), 10-12
[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), and 1-2 [](High_Paladin.md), led by an
[Inquisitor](Inquisitor.md "wikilink").

Once the reinforcements arrive, they will give a short speech, and then
start patrolling the player's base, attacking hostiles, defending the
player's characters, and healing wounded allies.

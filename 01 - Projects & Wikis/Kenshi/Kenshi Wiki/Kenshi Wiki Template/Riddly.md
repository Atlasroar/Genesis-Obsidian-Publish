**Riddly**is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink") found in
bars in [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") towns and villages.
She is a friendly, lone adventurer who strikes the player up on
conversation.

If told that the player wishes to build a settlement and asks her to
join, she will not join as she isn't much of the settler type. If asked
to join up on their adventure, however, she states that she was hoping
they would ask, and joins the squad for free.

She always spawns with the Honorable
[Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

She only has one line of unique dialogue, shared with several of the
experienced or old - lorewise - unique recruits.

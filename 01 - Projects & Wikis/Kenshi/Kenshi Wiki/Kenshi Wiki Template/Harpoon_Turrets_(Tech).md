**Harpoon Turrets** is [Defense Tech](Defense_Tech.md "wikilink") which
allows players to construct basic [Turrets](Turrets.md "wikilink"). There
are many related research options which improve accuracy and speed.

Turrets are not reliant on [Power](Power.md "wikilink") or ammunition, so
players can build them entirely standalone. Players find them to be
superior weapons against large enemies, such as [](Base_Assault.md) and [Leviathans](Leviathan.md "wikilink").
This is especially true when paired with other defenses, such as walls
and gates. Turrets can be built mounted on walls and the roofs of many
building types.

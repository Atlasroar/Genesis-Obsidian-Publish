![](AncientSamuraiSet.png "AncientSamuraiSet.png") **Ancient Samurai
Helmet** is a Heavy Armour that is equipped in the Headgear slot. As the
[Second Empire](Second_Empire.md "wikilink") remnants who are the only ones
to wear the Ancient Samurai armour set are purely composed of
[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") (who cannot use Headgear), this armour
cannot be found anywhere in the game. Had it existed in the game it
would have been part of a set together with [](Ancient_Samurai_Armour.md), [](Ancient_Samurai_Legplates.md) and [](Ancient_Samurai_Boots.md).

This armour has inventory dimensions of **3x3**.

## Appearance

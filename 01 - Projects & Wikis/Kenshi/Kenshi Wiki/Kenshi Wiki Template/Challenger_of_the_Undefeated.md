**Challenger of The Undefeated** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that
can trigger if the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has both
killed/captured the [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") and has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 26,000 meters of
the [Berserker Village](Berserker_Village.md "wikilink"). It has a 10%
chance to trigger each day if within 3,000 meters, this chance scales
down with distance until it reaches 0% at 26,000 meters. This has one of
the highest ranges of any territorial event, encompassing almost the
entire map with only the ocean in the northeastern corner being out of
range.

Once the conditions have been fulfilled, the
[Berserkers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink") will send an assault to the player's
base. This assault will consist of 2-8 squads, each made up of 2-8
[Berserkers](Berserker.md "wikilink").

Once the assault arrives, the War Leader will give a speech about how
the player is starting to be seen as a figure similar to the
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") in [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") culture,
and that they and their warriors are seeking a death worthy of granting
them entry to Gateway, the Shek afterlife. Once the speech is done, the
attack will begin, attacking gates and characters, and liberating
captives.

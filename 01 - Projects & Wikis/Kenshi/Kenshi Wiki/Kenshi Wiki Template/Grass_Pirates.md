**Grass Pirates** is a bandit faction found in the [](Stormgap_Coast.md) area. The faction appears to have two
types of characters: [Straw Lieutenants](Straw_Lieutenant.md "wikilink")
and [Grass Pirates](Grass_Pirate.md "wikilink"). They seem to have only
their own interests in mind as they squabble over territory with anyone
who comes in their area. They're always beefin' over turf with the
[United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") and are immediately hostile
towards the player faction. They can be recognised by their low quality
[Sleeveless Dustcoats](Sleeveless_Dustcoat.md "wikilink") and are a big
threat to low level players.

Unlike the vast majority of bandits, Grass Pirates actually have a
respectable martial arts skill, in the 20-40 range, making them a good
and easy to find option for training unarmed combat, as long as they are
disarmed beforehand.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

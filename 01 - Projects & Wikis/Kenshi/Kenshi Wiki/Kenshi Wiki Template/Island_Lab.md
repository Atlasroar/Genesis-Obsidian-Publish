## Tips

- If you have a character with a high
  [Assassination](Assassination.md "wikilink") skill, you can stealth KO
  the [Fishmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink") and remove their flesh (effectively
  killing them), then escape if they see you, and repeat.

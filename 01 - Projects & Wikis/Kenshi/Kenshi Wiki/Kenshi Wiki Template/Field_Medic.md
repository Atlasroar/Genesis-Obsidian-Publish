**Field Medic** is a very important [stat](Statistics.md "wikilink") that
directly influences a characters effectiveness at
[healing](Guide_to_Health.md "wikilink") and the use of [](Medical_Items.md). It also determines how effective
you are using the advanced types of these items.

Performing first aid or operating the [](Medical_Workbench.md) will level up a character's
Field Medic stat.

It is possible to heal any downed enemy or friend. Healing hurt but
conscious enemies is not always possible. Installing an [](Robot_Limbs.md) on a downed enemy will later open up an
option to heal that enemy if they were to get hurt again. This option is
normally not available when the enemy is still conscious.

## Trivia

- Catun was previously known as Capital, its original name. It was
  changed to Catan later.
  - In update 0.64, Catan was changed to Capan due to concern of the
    previous name being based on an already existed board game of the
    same name.[^1]
- Although Capital was changed to Catan (then later Capan, and now
  Catun), Capital still exists as a town in gamedata.base.

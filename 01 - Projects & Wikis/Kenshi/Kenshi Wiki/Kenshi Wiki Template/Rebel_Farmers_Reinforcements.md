**Rebel Farmers Reinforcements** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that
will trigger in response to the [](Eyegore's_Assault.md), [](Noble's_Wrath.md), or [](Noble's_Wrath_Assault.md) events as long as the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") is allied to the [](Rebel_Farmers.md) faction, the player has not killed or
captured [Boss Simion](Boss_Simion.md "wikilink"), and [](Yabuta_of_the_Sands.md) is either killed or still
imprisoned.

Once triggered, the [Rebel Farmers](Rebel_Farmers.md "wikilink") will send
reinforcements from [Fort Simion](Fort_Simion.md "wikilink") or a camp in
[The Great Desert](The_Great_Desert.md "wikilink") or
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"), whatever is closest. While they will
move faster than most hostile events, they can still arrive too late if
the player's [Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") is closer
to the hostile event's spawn location than to the origin of the
reinforcements. These reinforcements will consist of 1-2 squads, each
made up of 0-2 [Bonedogs](Bonedog.md "wikilink"), 3-7 [](Outlaw_Heavy.md), 0-3 [](Outlaw_Swordsman.md), led by an [](Outlaw_Swordsman_Captain.md).

Once the reinforcements arrive, they will give a short speech, and then
start patrolling the player's base, attacking hostiles, defending the
player's characters, and healing wounded allies.

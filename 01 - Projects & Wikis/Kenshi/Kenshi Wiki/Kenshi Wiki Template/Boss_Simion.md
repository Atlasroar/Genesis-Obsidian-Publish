**Boss Simion** is the leader of the [](Rebel_Farmers.md). He resides in [](Fort_Simion.md), named after himself and has a big
amount of personal bodyguards consisting of [](Outlaw_Swordsman_Captain.md) and [](Outlaw_Heavy.md) protecting him.

He has a Dumb [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

Boss Simion can be turned in for his [Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") to the
[United Cities](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink").

## History

![](Bodyguards.jpg "Bodyguards.jpg") Boss Simion's history is taken from
his diary, the [Men of Dirt](Men_of_Dirt.md "wikilink").

He was formerly a farmer in the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), along with his wife and daughter. Due
to competing with the massive [slave](Slavery.md "wikilink") workforce that
functioned effectively as free labor, he and his family could no longer
afford to stay in business, eventually becoming poverty stricken and
forced out by the Empire to wander [](The_Great_Desert.md).

After scavenging a caravan that was feasted on by
[skimmers](Skimmer.md "wikilink"), he acquired enough materials to get
through the season, using these supplies he would go on to build [](Fort_Simion.md). From here, he began taking in and
protecting the outcasts of the United Cities as if they were his
children, stealing from the [nobility](Noble_Circle.md "wikilink") that
took everything from them and staying out of sight.

It is implied, though unconfirmed, that prior to this his wife may have
left with their daughter. There is also a possibility that his wife may
have surrendered both herself and their daughter to slavery in order to
survive.

## Interactions

Players can go inside Fort Simion and speak to Boss Simion if the player
is neutral with Rebel Farmers, the dialogue options can be to attack him
for his bounty, leave him alone or ask if the player can join the Rebel
Farmers. In which the latter he will reply with that if the player truly
wishes to join them, they must declare themselves hostile with United
Cities (with preferred actions such as kicking nobles gut) and then
speak to them again.

Another way to join Rebel Farmers is to approach Boss Simion while
starving, bypassing the need to to attack United Cities.

If the player is already an enemy of United Cities, the player can gain
an alliance with Rebel Farmers and discuss about plans of how to destroy
UC.

If the player is allied with the
[Anti-Slavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink"), Simion will make a remark about
this and additional options regarding making an alliance with the Rebel
Farmers will be given.

If [Hamut](Hamut.md "wikilink") has been recruited and speaks to Boss
Simion while the other requirements for alliance have been met, he'll
remark on how he's heard of Hamut's attitude against slavers and the
United Cities.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

Requires Boss Simion to be alive and free:

If [Lord Nagata](Lord_Nagata.md "wikilink") is killed/imprisoned while Boss
Simion is alive and free, [Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink") will be
taken over by rebels.

If [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink") is dead or kidnapped, Boss
Simion will disappear, unless [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") and
[Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") are all dead or kidnapped as well, in
which case he would reside in Trader's Edge as a member of the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md).

Requires Boss Simion to be dead/imprisoned:

If Boss Simion is killed or imprisoned, the Rebel Farmer squads of
[outlaw farmers](Outlaw_Farmer.md "wikilink"),
[swordsman](Outlaw_Swordsman.md "wikilink") and
[heavies](Outlaw_Heavy.md "wikilink") will stop spawning.

## Trivia

- As stated above, if Lord Nagata or Emperor Tengu are dead or
  kidnapped, Boss Simion will disappear. The mod, [Move Rebel Farmer HQ
  to Sho-Battai](https://www.nexusmods.com/kenshi/mods/1042), corrects
  this issue by relocating Boss Simion to Sho-Battai.

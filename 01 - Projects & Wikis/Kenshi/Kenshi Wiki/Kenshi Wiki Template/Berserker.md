**Berserkers** are members of the [Berserkers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink")
faction. They can be found in [](Berserker_Village.md) and patrolling [](Stenn_Desert.md), [](Spider_Plains.md), [](Berserker_Country.md), and [](Cannibal_Plains.md). Taking down
[Seta](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md "wikilink") can make them travel up to even
[Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink"), assuming
[Ghost](Ghost.md "wikilink") is alive and free.

They have a Maniacal [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

## Interactions

Defeating the [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") prompts them to attack
the [player's outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"), in a
'[](Challenger_of_the_Undefeated.md)' event consisting
of at least 2 squads of Berserkers.

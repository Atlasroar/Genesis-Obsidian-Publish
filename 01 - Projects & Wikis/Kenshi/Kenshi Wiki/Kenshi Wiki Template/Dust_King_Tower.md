The **Dust King Tower**, home of the famous [](Dust_King.md), is located in the [](Border_Zone.md) on the edge of a cliffside overlooking the
river below. The tower's fortifications consist of Level 3 walls, a gate
and 5 [mounted crossbows](Mounted_Crossbow.md "wikilink") on the walls.
Defenders can number up to 20+ [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandit.md "wikilink")
and a handful of [Dust Bosses](Dust_Boss.md "wikilink"), presumably
lieutenants of the King. Unique Recruit [Cat](Cat.md "wikilink") is
imprisoned on the third floor of the tower, on the prison level.

## Items

This location has a gear [Artifacts](Artifacts.md "wikilink") value of
10,000 Cats, meaning it will spawn armour and weapons from the Artifacts
system. This location also has a total item count of 30 items and it
refreshes every 24 hours.

## Tips

- The best way to unlock the front gate is from the side of the
  staircase, rather than going directly in front of the gate itself.
  From this position, you're less likely to be seen (you're behind the
  main wall, not the transparent gate), and are less open to crossbow
  fire from the turrets. You can even open the gate from here without
  drawing any alarm, allowing your entire group to enter the base
  without resistance.
- Upon entering the gate, you will most likely be swarmed. With low
  level characters, you will no doubt be wiped, and once downed the
  [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandits.md "wikilink") will pick you up and imprison
  you inside of cages on the third floor. The [](Dust_King.md) will either be outside, and can easily be
  lured to a safer place away from the tower, or he will be inside and
  will be one of the last bandits to come after you. In the case of the
  former, you can get him to chase you far away from the aggro range of
  the others. Otherwise, you will have to fight through the rest of the
  bandits, which can easily result in a wipe and party deaths.
- It is possible to claim the [Dust King's](Dust_King.md "wikilink") bounty
  very early in the game if one hires a team or two of
  [Mercenaries](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Mercenary_Guild.md "wikilink") to storm the tower for them.
  Simply unlock and open the gate and enter with your hired blades, and
  wait for him to go down to collect the bounty. The disadvantages of
  this are that a single character is unlikely to be able to collect all
  of the loot from the tower, and missing out on the experience from
  both Dust Bandit raids, and the fight itself.

## Trivia

- If you become allied to the [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandits.md "wikilink")
  faction through either [FCS](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md "wikilink") or
  the slavery trick, you can enter and use the [](Camp_Bed.md) inside of the tower, as well as man the
  Mounted Crossbows on the wall. Despite the fact that the bandits
  inside will say you're trespassing, they will never become hostile or
  raise an alarm, and you're free to remain inside as long as you want.

**Grey**is a member of the [Anti-Slavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") that
oversees new initiates. He can be found accompanying
[Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") in the Faction HQ in
[Spring](Spring.md "wikilink").

If you wish to convince him to allow you to join into the
[Anti-Slavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") you must prove you're an enemy
of their enemy. Doing so will see you face against many powerful foes.

The alternative way of joining Anti-Slavers is having the
'Ex-slave/Escaped slave' status and speak to Grey, doing so they will
consider you a refugee and allow you to join. Killing the
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") will also grant you entrance into the
Anti-Slavers.

He is also the only NPC that can completely clear off the above status
when talked to under it. Doing so opens the character edit screen, and
upon pressing "OK", clears the slave status immmediately.

Like the rest of his allies, Grey is wanted by the[](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md).

## Trivia

- When attempting to join the Anti-Slavers, Grey will either reject the
  player due to not meeting at least one requirement, or will mention
  one of the few [accomplishments](World_States.md "wikilink") the player
  has made before confirming the enrollment. Depending on the types of
  the player's deeds, his comment may be wary if the player is an enemy
  to Anti-Slavers' enemies but has not achieved much (in which case he
  will also ask the player for a reason why they want to join), or it
  may be more enthusiastic (then he will say that the player would be
  "more than a useful addition" to the faction).
- When talking to him as an ex-slave with the status still on the player
  prior to joining Anti-Slaver, he will show pity and clear it without
  using the character edit. However, once joined, anytime talking to him
  will always open the edit screen before clearing the status.

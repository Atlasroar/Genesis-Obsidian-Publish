[item](Items.md "wikilink") that serves no practical purpose in the game
other than adding flavour to the world. It can be found in a multitude
of places, including Sand Ninja Oni's Tower at Spine Canyon and ruined
houses in places like [Bast](Bast.md "wikilink").

One of them can also be found in [Fort Simion](Fort_Simion.md "wikilink")
in the inventory of [Boss Simion](Boss_Simion.md "wikilink"). Because his
inventory also includes [Men of Dirt](Men_of_Dirt.md "wikilink"), there is
heavy speculation that this was previously owned by his daughter.

**Distant Hive Village** is a [Minor Outpost](Minor_Outposts.md "wikilink")
controlled by the [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink"). There are two
Distant Hive Villages in [Sinkuun](Sinkuun.md "wikilink"). It is likely
named so because of it's distance from the [heartlands](Vain.md "wikilink")
of the Western Hive.

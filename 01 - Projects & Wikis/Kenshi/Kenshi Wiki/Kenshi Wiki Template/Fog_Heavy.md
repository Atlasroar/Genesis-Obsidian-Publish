**Fog Heavies** are members the [Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") faction.
They are the soldier variant of the [](Hive_Soldier_Drone.md) for the Deadhive. Fog Heavies are
often usually found escorting a [Fog Prince](Fog_Prince.md "wikilink") in
groups of 3 to 5.

Fog Heavies are corrupted Hive Soldier Drones. They lurk in the [](Fog_Islands.md) in groups and are hostile towards
anyone they come across. Like all Fogmen, they will kidnap nearby
unconscious characters except skeletons.

Fog Heavies can also be found in the [](Tower_of_Fog.md) and [](Deadhive_Overrun.md).

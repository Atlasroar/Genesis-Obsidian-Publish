**Bad Teeth** is a [Major Town](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") guarding a
mountain pass between the fertile valley of [](Okran's_Pride.md) and hostile wilderness of the
[Skinner's Roam](Skinner's_Roam.md "wikilink"). Unlike
[Stack](Stack.md "wikilink") and [Blister Hill](Blister_Hill.md "wikilink"),
there are no buildings which are unique to this location.

Bad Teeth is one of the two locations for the "Holy Nation Citizen"
[game start](Game_Starts.md "wikilink") (the other one is **Stack**). This
town can be an advantageous starting location since the Gate Guards
frequently kill roaming [River Raptors](River_Raptor.md "wikilink") which
can easily be looted for profit. It can also be discovered via
exploration or by reading the **Glorious Holy [Map](Maps.md "wikilink")**.

In [older versions](Old_World.md "wikilink") of the game, the city was
located on the eastern edge of the map and had a large number of
barracks and not a single bar, looking more like a military outpost than
an actual city.

[Bard](Bard.md "wikilink") and [Griffin](Griffin.md "wikilink") could spawn
here to be recruited.

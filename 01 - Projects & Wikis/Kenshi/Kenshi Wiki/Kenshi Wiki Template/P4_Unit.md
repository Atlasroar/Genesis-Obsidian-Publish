![](P4-Unit.png "P4-Unit.png") The **P4 Unit** is a subrace variant of a
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink"). Presently, it is impossible to create a
P4 Unit player character at the beginning of an unmodded game. Through
random low chance players can still recruit one, as they can potentially
spawn as a [Generic Recruit](Generic_Recruits.md "wikilink"). The subrace's
unique feature is the reduced 150 head HP (contrary to 200 HP in most
other Skeletons) as well as a Healrate of 3.0.

Due to their increased experience rates they are useful for crafting
jobs.

The game also features the even more improved [](Skeleton_P4MkII.md), a presumed further improvement of
the P4 Unit line.

## Trivia

- Many high ranking skeletons found throughout the game are the P4
  Units. This fact, their increased science and crafting skills, as well
  as their more delicate heads can lead to a speculation that this
  subrace of Skeletons was designed to be leaders and commanders.

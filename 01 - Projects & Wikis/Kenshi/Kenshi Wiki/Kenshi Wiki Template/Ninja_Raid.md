**Ninja Raid** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 5,000 meters of
the [Cactus Den](Cactus_Den.md "wikilink"). It has a 15% chance to trigger
each day if within 3,500 meters, this scales down with distance until it
reaches 0% at 5,000 meters. The event cannot trigger if the [](Sand_Ninja_Oni.md) is killed or captured, or if the player
is allied with the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") or [](Traders_Guild.md).

Once the conditions are fulfilled, the [](Sand_Ninjas.md) will send an assault to the player's
base. This assault will consist of 3-5 squads, each made up of 3-5 [](Sand_Ninja.md).

leader will give a short speech, then order the assault to begin,
breaking down gates, attacking characters, and freeing prisoners.

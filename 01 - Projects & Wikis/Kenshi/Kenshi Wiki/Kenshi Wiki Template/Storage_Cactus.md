**Storage: Cactus** is a single-item [Storage](Storage.md "wikilink")
container which holds [Cactus](Cactus.md "wikilink"). It can be constructed
after researching [Cactus Farming](Cactus_Farming_(Tech).md "wikilink").

Characters will pick up the [Cactus](Cactus.md "wikilink") from the Storage
for [Chewsticks](Chewsticks.md "wikilink") and [Rum](Rum_Still.md "wikilink")
crafting automatically.

**NOTE:** The characters will auto-haul into the storage when they
assigned to care for a farm. Make sure when you set multiple tasks for a
character, hauling into the storage is the last thing on they list, or
at least hauling into a storage is after they put the material into
machines. Otherwise they will go back-and-forth between the two
building.

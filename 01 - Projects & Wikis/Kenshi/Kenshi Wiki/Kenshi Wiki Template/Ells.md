**Ells** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink"). He is a fat,
alcoholic, simple-minded [Empire](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") citizen with
a small [Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") on his head for stealing alcohol
from distilleries, which can expire like all small bounties. He wanders
around town, begging for food. When recruited, he has 3 bottles of
[cactus rum](Cactus_Rum.md "wikilink") in his inventory.

He can be found in [Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink"), no matter what
[World States](World_States.md "wikilink") are affecting it. He will join
the player after they give him 300 Cats. If you can't find Ells, check
by the [outhouses](Outhouse.md "wikilink").

He has a Dumb [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink"). He doesn't have any
lines of unique dialogue in zone entries but he does have a unique
dialogue package.

He is incorrectly described as a Greenlander on his bounty description.

## Trivia

- He was also called both "Pickles" and "Squint" at some point in
  Kenshi's development, which can be found in his dialogue package in
  the FCS. In rare instances, he will even incorrectly refer to himself
  as Squint in game.
- Due to the small amount of bounty that Ells is assigned with, it's
  likely for the player to notice him AFTER the bounty has expired.

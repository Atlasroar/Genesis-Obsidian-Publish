**Endin** is a ruined city found in [Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink") under
control of the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"). Currently
inhabited by peasants and other exiles and outlaws. It can be found by
exploration or by acquiring and reading the **[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of
the United Cities (Central Territories)**.

The only intact building is a storm house often occupied by a few
vagrants or exiles from the United Cities. They are fairly harmless and
unlikely to be hostile unless you are hostile to the United Cities
yourself. The camp beds inside are free for your squad to use. There are
few junk items located inside the building. ![](Endin.png "Endin.png")

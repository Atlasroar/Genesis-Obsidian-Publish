![](Holy_Assault_Range.jpg "Holy_Assault_Range.jpg") **Holy Assault** is
an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") which occurs when the player outpost is
within 9,000 meters of a [Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")
location, and the player has hostile relations with the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) faction, and as long as the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), and [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) are still alive and free.
It will have up to a 15% chance to trigger each day if you are within
5,000 meters of a [Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") owned
location, and scales down with distance until it reaches 0% chance at
9,000 meters away.

It consists of a squad of 3-4 [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), 5 [](Holy_Sentinel.md), and 10-15 [](Holy_Chosen.md), led by an additional
[Paladin](Paladin.md "wikilink"). Once they arrive at the outpost, the
leader will give a small speech that changes based on past interactions,
and order his men to charge.

If the raid is victorious, they will occupy the player's base,
patrolling around it, using the furniture, freeing captives, and
imprisoning your characters. If the raid is defeated, there is an 80%
chance to trigger a [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Minor).md) event 100 to 250 hours
afterward.

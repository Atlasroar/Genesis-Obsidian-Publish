![](Enemy_Hunt_Range.jpg "Enemy_Hunt_Range.jpg") The Shek's **Enemy
Hunt** is a base assault [event](Events.md "wikilink") that can occur when
the player has a hostile relation level with the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md), and lives within 9,000 meters of a
location owned by them. It can have up to 50% chance to trigger each day
if within 3,000 meters, this chance will scale down with distance until
it reaches 0% at 9,000 meters away.

If the conditions above are met, the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) will send an assault to the player's
base. The assault will consist of 1-2 squads, each made up of 3-5 [](Shek_Warrior.md) and 1-3 [](Hundred_Guardian.md), and led by an additional
[Hundred Guardian](Hundred_Guardian.md "wikilink").

When it arrives, the War Leader will call out the player, generally
taunting them and calling them a coward. Amusingly, sometimes the War
Leader will refer to themself as a member of the [](The_Five_Invincibles.md), despite the fact that they are a
[Hundred Guardian](Hundred_Guardian.md "wikilink").

After the dialogue, the assault will attack the player's base, breaking
down gates and attacking characters. If they are victorious, they will
leave the base shortly. If they are defeated, there is a 30% chance to
trigger the [](Shek_Challengers_(Shek_Kingdom).md) event in 72-150
hours, a 50% chance to trigger the [](Shek_Revenge.md) event in 72-150 hours, and if this
event was a territorial trigger then there is a 20% chance to trigger a
second [Enemy Hunt](Enemy_Hunt.md "wikilink") event in 72-150 hours.

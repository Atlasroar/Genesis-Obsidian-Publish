**Prisoner Shackles** are automatically equipped on a character when
they are [enslaved](Slavery.md "wikilink"). Any gear in the
"[Boots](Footwear.md "wikilink")" slot will be placed on the floor.
Shackles weigh 20kg so that slaves are weighed down and run slower.
Stealth of characters wearing prisoner's shackles is seriously debuffed,
and the athletics skill is debuffed by 20%.

Shackles can be removed by [Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink"), using
[Tools](Hacksaw.md "wikilink"), or broken off using
[Strength](Strength.md "wikilink"). These items have a lockpicking level of
20 and a strength level of 20.

Equipping these on a character will immediately give that person the
[Slave](Slave.md "wikilink") status. However, they are not considered a
slave of the [player's faction](Nameless.md "wikilink"), but usually a
slave of the faction where the shackles originated from.

[Hive](Hive.md "wikilink"), [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink"), and characters
of other races which have [Robot Limbs](Robot_Limbs.md "wikilink") equipped
on both legs will be given [](Hive_Prisoner_Shackles.md) instead, as they are unable
to wear "normal" boots.

This footwear has inventory dimensions of **2x4**.

## Trivia

- If the character is bought from slavery, unequipping and re-equiping
  the now unlocked shackles will assign the 'Escaped Slave' status, but
  the faction of origin is unspecified, defaulting to "Someone".
- NPCs who have AI packages which include "LOOTING" will loot Prisoner
  Shackles if a slave in knocked unconscious nearby them, locking it
  into their own inventory.

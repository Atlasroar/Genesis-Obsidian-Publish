Prospecting is a player character activity, used to find suitable
locations to build bases. The speed and scale of prospecting analysis is
affected by the character's [Science](Science.md "wikilink") skill.

While some of the information obtained from Prospecting is purely
cosmetic, most of the results can be used to determine the suitability
of a location for a [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md).

Prospecting can be assigned to a player character by pressing the
"Prospect" button in lower-right part of the screen.

## Prospecting Results Screen

- Zone is the name of a region where the prospecting took place.
- Altitude shows how far above the sea level the current location spot
  is.
- Prospector Skill is the [Science](Science.md "wikilink") stat of the
  prospector. This determines the size of the prospected area.
- Area Size.
- Wind Speed is the current speed of the wind. This shows how much
  energy can be generated with [](Wind_Generator.md) at this location.
- [Environment](Environment.md "wikilink") shows what soil types are in the
  area and is also used in determining the crop yield of different types
  of farms.
- Resources
  - Water determines the efficiency of [wells](Well.md "wikilink").
  - Fertility determines the efficiency of [farms](Farming.md "wikilink").
  - Stone determines the efficiency of [](Stone_Mine.md).
  - Iron is used to determine the efficiency of mining [](Raw_Iron.md) from under the ground. It also shows the
    location of iron outcrops on the prospecting map.
  - Copper is used to determine the efficiency of mining
    [copper](Copper.md "wikilink") from under the ground (unreachable in an
    un-modded game). It also shows the location of copper outcrops on
    the prospecting map.

## Suggested Base Building Location

*Standardized format coming to a webpage near you soon.*

### Resources

- [Okran's Pride](Okran's_Pride.md "wikilink"), just South of [](Blister_Hill.md), is often used as a starter base due to
  the efficiency in growing [vegetables](Vegetable_Farm.md "wikilink"),
  [wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink"), and [hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink"),
  along with its bountiful [iron ore](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink"). However,
  [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") will not approve of the
  settlement if they find out non-humans are living there.

#### <u>Bugs</u>

- Having the resolution at 1080 will result in the numbers from
  prospecting being covered by the map image. Though some say this can
  be resolved with a restart, there is another bug that causes the game
  to start in a lower resolution than what is put in the settings. The
  easy solution to that glitch is to simply press ALT + ENTER to change
  the resolution without having to restart the game. Though this makes
  it so that the game has the right resolution(1080p), it messes with
  some parts of the UI like the Prospecting window. Pressing ALT + ENTER
  again changes the resolution back, and is therefore a functioning
  workaround.

Where as this is not a big problem with most parts of the UI, some parts
of the prospecting window scales poorly in 1080 resolution. This might
be due to the UI window itself potentially being an image file with
clickable areas, while other parts are put on top of it are separate in
a sense, and scales differently.

##  Trivia

Up until version 0.93 at least, a character could also prospect for
[Carbon](Carbon.md "wikilink").

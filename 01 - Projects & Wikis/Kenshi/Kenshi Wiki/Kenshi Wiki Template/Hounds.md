![](Hounds_2.png "Hounds_2.png") ![](Hounds.png "Hounds.png")
![](Hounds_4.png "Hounds_4.png") The **Hounds** are one of the gangs
from [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"), and the most powerful of them.
They are the primary [Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink") growers, which is the main
ingredient of [Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink"), an illegal narcotic
substance. Their leader [Big Grim](Big_Grim.md "wikilink") is purportedly
very insane, but was smart enough to manipulate all the other clans to
bring the Hounds to the top. They have a [](Faction_HQ.md) building located within
[Shark](Shark.md "wikilink") and a village within [](The_Swamp.md) named [Rot](Rot.md "wikilink").

## Characters

- [Big Grim](Big_Grim.md "wikilink")
- [Ears](Ears.md "wikilink")
- [Hound](Hound.md "wikilink")

## Joining the Hounds

If you build a base inside [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"), a pack of
[Hounds](Hound.md "wikilink") may come to visit you and tell you that, if
you want their protection, you should talk to Ears.

### Ears

[Ears](Ears.md "wikilink") can be found in the Dancing Skeleton bar in
[Shark](Shark.md "wikilink"). Ears says that he can help your faction "get
noticed" by [Big Grim](Big_Grim.md "wikilink") for a price. After paying
Ears 2,000 Cats, you can now speak to Big Grim.

**Note:** You don't have to build a base within [](The_Swamp.md) in order to join the Hounds. You only need
to to find Ears roaming within Shark.

### Smuggling Hashish

[Big Grim](Big_Grim.md "wikilink") can be found in the Hounds faction
headquarters (the other swamp dome next to the Dancing Skeleton). Grim
says you can join her gang if you do a task for her. If the player
accepts, they will receive [Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink") to smuggle into
the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink").

The closest United Cities city is [Clownsteady](Clownsteady.md "wikilink").
In order to sell illegal goods ([Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink")) to a
vendor in the city, characters must find a [](Thief_Fence.md) inside of a [](Shinobi_Thieves.md) tower or there is a chance to find
one in a local bar. To trade in a Thieves Tower, players must be allied
with the Shinobi Thieves.

Players don't need to actually sell the Hashish in order to complete
this task. Players simply need to return with the money.

After a day or two, return to [Big Grim](Big_Grim.md "wikilink") and pay
her the money which you received (or would have received) for selling
the [Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink"). You are given the option to pay the
full amount of 4,000 Cats or come up short with only 3,000 Cats. Grim is
not forgiving when players come up short. After this payment, you are
allied with the Hounds and village called [Rot](Rot.md "wikilink") becomes
green on your map.

### Farming Hemp

If the player speaks to Big Grim again, Grim will give them the task of
creating a base out in [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink") to farm more
[Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink") for their operation. Grim will give the player
10 [Building Materials](Building_Materials.md "wikilink") to start them
out.

After picking any location in The Swamp, set up your base. [](Swamp_Raptor.md) will come to eat your
[Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink") farms so you should build walls and other
defenses.

The [Red Sabres](Red_Sabre.md "wikilink") will launch a [](Base_Assault.md), but the Hounds will also immediately
send reinforcements to help with this. When reinforcements arrive, they
will patrol your base for an entire day and then leave. The Hounds will
easily defeat the [Red Sabre](Red_Sabre.md "wikilink") Assault, as the
generic NPC Hounds typically have twice the combat stats of the Red
Sabres.

The Hounds will also send groups to check in with your base. These
groups will warn you about the [Stone Rats](Stone_Rats.md "wikilink") and
collect [Big Grim](Big_Grim.md "wikilink")'s cut of c. 2,000.
Reinforcements and check-ins will be made up of
[Hound](Hound.md "wikilink") NPCs exclusively.

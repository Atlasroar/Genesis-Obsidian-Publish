**The Gorrillo Bandits** are a minor [](Hostile_Factions.md) found in the southern part of the
world.

All Gorillo Bandits, except for their leader, are [](Martial_Arts.md), using [Gi](Gi.md "wikilink") as body
armor and only light armor in the shirt and trouser slots in combat.

This makes them weak against ranged attack but on the other hand, no one
can disarm them when they are down.

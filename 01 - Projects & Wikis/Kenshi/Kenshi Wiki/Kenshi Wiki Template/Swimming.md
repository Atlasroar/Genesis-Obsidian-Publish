**Swimming** is one of Kenshi's in-game [stats](Statistics.md "wikilink").
While increases in a character's [Athletics](Athletics.md "wikilink") stat
has more universal benefits, an increase in a character's swimming stat
can help in evading certain enemies by escaping through large bodies of
liquid. Despite the in-game description, characters cannot drown in
water and can therefore swim indefinitely.

[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") can improve their swimming stat despite
not needing it because they do not swim. Animals can continue attacking
while in shallow water.

## Swim Speed

A character's max Swim Speed is determined by their race and excluding
Skeletons, can only be reached at level 100. Skeletons have a locked
"swim" speed of 30 (their swim speed is double their walk speed) units
which never increases.

To find the swim speed (in units) of a character you can enter the
following:

$\text{Swim Speed} = 6 + \text{Swimming Level} \times \text{Swim Speed Multiplier} \times 0.38$

All prosthetic limbs have a negative effect on your swimming level.

### Swim Speed Multipliers

- 0.5 — Sheks
- 1.0 — Humans, Hivers, Garru, Bonedogs and many other animals
- 1.1 - Black Gorillo
- 1.5 — Bulls & Beakthings

## Ways to Train

### Swimming around in water

Swimming in water is time consuming but water can easily be found in the
following regions:

- [Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink")
- [Wend](Wend.md "wikilink")
- [South Wetlands](South_Wetlands.md "wikilink")
- [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink")

Swimming off the coast in most places is also safe, however in a couple
regions the bodies of water are Acid and will be damaging to characters
which are not [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink") or
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink"). When swimming in Acid,
[Weather](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") protections do not apply.

- [Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink")
- [Vain](Vain.md "wikilink")

You can double your XP gain by carrying another character while
swimming. Please note that you will not gain STR when swimming.

## Speed

The following table shows the maximum swim speed for an unencumbered
character of a certain race at milestone levels. These numbers on the
left are in Kenshi units per second. 1 Kenshi unit is 0.1 meters. The
value on the right is the Mph in game. To get the miles per hour value
from units, simply multiply them by 0.2237. Round to nearest whole
number to get the value shown in-game.

## Trivia

- Sheks have the lowest swim speed multiplier of any race in Kenshi. It
  is so low that even with max level swimming they are still slower than
  Skeletons/other non-swimmers.
- Bulls and Beakthings are the fastest swimmers in Kenshi. Although
  Raptors have an insane 4x swim speed mult and Fishmen have a 5x swim
  speed mult, they are "non-swimmers", so they only go 6.711 mph at all
  levels under water.
- Swimming (Is not stated anywhere in game but discovered through
  testing) levels up twice as fast when carrying another character. This
  may be due to the fact that while swimming you do not gain strength xp
  for being encumbered. Please note that you do not gain bonus xp for
  being encumbered when swimming, it's only for carrying another unit.

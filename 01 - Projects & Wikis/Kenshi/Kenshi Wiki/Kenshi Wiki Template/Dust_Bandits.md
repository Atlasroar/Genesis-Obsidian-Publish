**Dust Bandits** are a hostile faction found around the [](Border_Zone.md). Dust Bandits are better trained and
equipped than some other bandit groups, like [](Starving_Bandits.md). Members of this faction wear a
distinctive uniform of a makeshift style. [](Spiked_Helmet.md), [](Heart_Protector.md), [](Armoured_Rag_Skirt.md) and [](Samurai_Boots.md) appear to be common for all of them.
They often engage in extortionist tactics, attempting to get their
victims to pay tribute to them to prevent attacks from their raiding
parties.

They are led by a man known as the [Dust King](Dust_King.md "wikilink"),
who is much stronger than your average bandit and carries a large bounty
on his head.

## Outpost Interactions

Dust Bandits are able to organize base assaults on player's outposts.

Sometimes they will deliver bandit demands. Their designated "War
Leader" will show up. If you speak to him, he will demand that the
outpost delivers a certain number of [Cats](Cats.md "wikilink") at specific
intervals. The player can agree or refuse, with the latter causing the
bandit army to attack.

There are also a few dialogue options that allow the player character to
simply stab the War Leader in the face (or guts) mid-conversation. This
will cause him to scream in pain, and his entire army will flee.
However, they will show back up a few days later, doubled in size.

See [Events](Events.md "wikilink") page for a full list.

## Other Interactions

When the player nears a group of Dust Bandits on patrol, sometimes the
leader will initiate dialog with you and demand [Cats](Cats.md "wikilink")
from your party for safe passage. If the responding character has no
backpack equipped, giving him 500c will prevent them from attacking you.
Giving them 300c will have them demand more money from you rather than
ending the dialog. If the character has a backpack equipped, however,
the bandit will assume that you're hiding more money inside and demand
more even if you gave them 500c.

By preemptively speaking to a Dust Bandit, they will sometimes very
bluntly ask if you wish to fight them. Choosing "No" might be enough to
prevent hostilities.

## Non-Player Characters

This faction has a clear hierarchy:

- [Dust King](Dust_King.md "wikilink")

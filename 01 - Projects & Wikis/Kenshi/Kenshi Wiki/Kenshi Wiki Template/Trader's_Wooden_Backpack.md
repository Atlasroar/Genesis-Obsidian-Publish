**Trader's Backpack** is a [backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") that allows
for carrying of large quantities of trade goods and building materials
due to its allowance of stacking items. Can be purchased from any
General [Item Trader](Item_Trader.md "wikilink"). Stackable bonus minimum
and mult are both 3 resulting in the ability to stack items up to 9x
their normal amount.

The built-in sun shader provides no benefits and is purely cosmetic. The
**Trader's Wooden Backpack**has slightlylarger penalties, so it is an
inferior version to the [Wooden Backpack](Wooden_Backpack.md "wikilink").

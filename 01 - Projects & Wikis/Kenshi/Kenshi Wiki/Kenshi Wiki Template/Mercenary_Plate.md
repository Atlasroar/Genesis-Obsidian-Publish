## Appearance

Mercenary Plate is built from several different pieces of armour
plating. From the shoulders to mid-chest are heavily protected by pieces
of armour plating designed with the appearance of muscles. The shoulders
are protected by giant pauldrons. Wristguards held by leather bands
cover the forearms and hands of the character. Despite all this, the
armour leaves the stomach fairly exposed.

This item can also be found in different colours throughout the world.
For example a blue variant can be found on
[Slavemongers](Slavemonger.md "wikilink"), and a black variant on [](Shop_Guard.md).

## Trivia

- Despite its name, and the claim that it has become standard amongst
  their kind, no members of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Mercenary_Guild.md) wear Mercenary Plate. A
  [mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405404519)
  has been released that fixes this.

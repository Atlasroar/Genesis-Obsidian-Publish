**Holy Nation Robots** are randomly-named possible recruits found
patrolling [Northern Coast](Northern_Coast.md "wikilink"), [](Okran's_Valley.md), and [Wend](Wend.md "wikilink") in
squads of 1-4. They are members of the [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink")
faction

They have a 20% chance of having a bounty of 2000 Cats. They have a
unique recruitment dialogue that may become available when they see a
player character and the following conditions are met:

- They are in a squad consisting only of themselves (meaning, they
  spawned alone and without followers);
- They have never seen the player before;
- They are not imprisoned;
- The player is not imprisoned;
- The player is within talking range;
- The player is not inside a non-player town;
- The player is not the same race as them (meaning, not a Skeleton);
- The player is not in combat; and
- Their Strength, Dexterity, Melee Attack, Melee Defence, Martial Arts,
  and Dodge are all less than 25 or the cumulative total of these
  statistics is less than 75. (In FCS this condition is named
  DC_IS_RECRUITABLE).

This is a rare occurrence given their base statistics, which often
causes them to exceed the recruitable threshold. If all the triggering
conditions are met however and they see the player, they will say aloud
"He/She saw me ..." followed by "... Do what you will, human ..." At
that point, they can be clicked on to initiate further dialogue, just
like when other NPCs make announcements. Offering to help them repair
their damage in this dialogue (regardless of whether they actually have
any injuries) and proclaiming defiance of the Holy Nation will result in
recruitment. Stating that you just like helping people and have no
hidden agenda though will result in the dialogue ending without
recruitment.

## Tips

- There is a 48 internal hour cooldown after the Holy nation robot
  dialogue is triggered. If the dialogue "He/they saw me ..." was played
  and criteria was not met, the interaction path to recruitment cannot
  occur and the player needs to wait the timer before trying to interact
  with another potential holy nation robot recruit.
- The dialogue to recruit these skeletons can only occur once per
  game/import, even if the skeleton in question meets all the
  recruitment criteria.
- They are most commonly found roaming through [Wend](Wend.md "wikilink").
- You can, if you want to, try to recruit these (and many other)
  characters through a [Slave Recruit](Slave_Recruits.md "wikilink")
  exploit. If successful, the price to free a Holy Nation Robot from
  Slavers is 20,000 [Cats](Cats.md "wikilink").

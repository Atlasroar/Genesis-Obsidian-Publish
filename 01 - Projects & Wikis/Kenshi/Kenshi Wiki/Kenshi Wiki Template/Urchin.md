The "Urchin" is possibly a fossilized species of fauna (or flora),
resembling the likeness of a giant sea-urchin. Speculation has lead to
the theory that said Urchins indicate the heightened water level at some
previous point in time. The Urchin is specifically named "LandUrchin01"
within the game files.

**Priest Varloo's Note** is a [book](Lore_Books.md "wikilink")
[item](Items.md "wikilink") which can only be found in [](The_Hub.md). This item is unique to an abandoned
residential building found in The Hub.

In that same residence, there are also four other unique items which
combine to give a history of The Hub and why [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) has abandoned it.

Players have speculated that the 'wraiths' mentioned in this note could
easily be members of the [Shinobi Thieves](Shinobi_Thieves.md "wikilink"),
especially since The Hub is home to a [](Thieves_Guild.md).

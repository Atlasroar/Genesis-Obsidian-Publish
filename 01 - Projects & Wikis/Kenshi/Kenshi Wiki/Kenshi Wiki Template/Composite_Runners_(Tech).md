## Bugs

- This research is currently bugged and will not add an additional 5%
  damage to Mounted Crossbows or Mounted Crossbow mkII if done after
  [](Crossbow_Turret_Strings_(Tech).md). If done prior to
  the 10% research it will be overwritten by it later. If not after the
  Crossbow Turret Strings research it will override the 10% bonus with
  the 5% one until you save/load the game at which point the Crossbow
  Turret Strings (Tech) multiplier of 1.1x will be used again making
  this research useless. Attempts at modding this research to give 1.15x
  instead of 1.05x will result in the same overwrite of 1.1x after
  reloading.

**Wooden Sandals** are armour that is equipped in the Boots slot. They
can be bought from a Boot Trader or looted off of Bandits.

They provide no protection, but increase the wearer's effective
[Athletics](Athletics.md "wikilink") skill, allowing them to run faster.
Asides from that, they also provide a slight bonus to Combat speed
effect.

This footwear has inventory dimensions of **2x4**.

## Appearance

Wooden Sandals are simple footwear made from wood. They are similar in
appearance to the Japanese Geta. A leather band keeps the sandals held
in place on the feet.

## Trivia

If the player looks closely at the feet of their character, they can
notice that their feet are "floating" slightly above the ground (unless
the character is a [Hiver](Hiver.md "wikilink")), it is likely made so that
it fits wooden sandals so if the characters put them on it will not
appear as if it's buried into the ground.

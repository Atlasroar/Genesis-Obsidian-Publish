**Pia** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink"). She is a fast
runner. Her sister Naevia was also a member of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md), but recently "died doing what she
loved doing, fighting the Paladins."

She can be found in [Flotsam Village](Flotsam_Village.md "wikilink") and
has a Dumb personality.

Like [Miu](Miu.md "wikilink") who spots spiders, Pia is always on alert for
Holy Paladins, acting as a useful radar for the group.

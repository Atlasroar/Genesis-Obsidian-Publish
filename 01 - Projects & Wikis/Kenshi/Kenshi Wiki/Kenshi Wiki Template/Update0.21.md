**Version 0.21**

__TOC__

## 0.21.0

#### FEATURES

- you can now bring up the right-click menu by clicking on a characters
  portrait.
- characters are now aware of what other characters in the squad are
  doing and are less likely to do things like heal the same target while
  someone else is bleeding to death.
- characters in a squad can communicate. If a character needs to heal,
  he can ask the squad to halt the patrol. If a character is wounded and
  has no medkits he can ask someone else to heal him.
- when a whole squad is defeated, any character that gains consciousness
  will stay down until all enemies are out of range.
- removed a few old items, added new ones. Chain head-wrap, martial
  artists Gi, and tricorner hat.
- Due to unpopularity, the plank has been changed to a lighter, hacker
  class weapon, but its still cool
- when you right-click an enemy it commands your character(s) to attack
  all of them, instead of targeting that single enemy. If you want to
  attack a certain enemy you can choose it from the right-click menu.
  This should stop newbies getting so confused.

#### BUGFIXES

- stopped graphical flickering bugs
- reduced video card requirements to vertex shader 2.0
- some people had a crash when opening shops, this may be fixed now.

## 0.21.1

- hopefully fixed the "everything invisible" bug. let me know on the
  forums if its not fixed.
- medics now heal the vital bodyparts first

## 0.21.2

#### FEATURES

- You can now carry wounded people. Select someone healthy, hold down
  the right mouse button on a collapsed character and choose "Pick up".
  To put down again, use the right-click menu again on yourself and
  choose "Put down".
- As well as a medkit, you need a splint kit to make bodyparts (slightly
  more) useable again. Bandages now only cause healing.
- You now need both arms functional to use a heavy weapon.
- You need a one-handed weapon to fight while carrying someone.
- There is more to be done on this, like bed rest and more
  medical/damage stat effects, but for now I think its a good mid-way
  update.

#### BUG FIXES

- You no longer need to install PhysX.
- Fixed characters not getting up when healed
- Lots of little things

#### FUTURE

- I'm going to focus on the foliage system so that I can hire an
  environment artist. Then I will go back to the medical system for some
  more features.

## 0.21.3â€“0.21.6

- Minor stability fixes

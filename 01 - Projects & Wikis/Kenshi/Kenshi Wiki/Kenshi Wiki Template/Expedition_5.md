**Expedition 5** is a location similar to [](Expedition_4.md). It is a partially ruined town with lots of
components on ground around buildings. It can be found east of
[Spring](Spring.md "wikilink") and south of [](Reaver_Camp.md).

This location was created by the [Tech Hunters](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink")
during their fifth expedition south. This location is referenced in
[](Tech_Hunter's_Notes_Series.md). Although the number
implicates that there were 4 expeditions before it, only the 4th one has
an observable abandoned settlement, it's not explicitly stated in the
game what the results of the other expeditions were.

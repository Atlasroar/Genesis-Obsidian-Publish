**Anti-Slavers (unarmed)** are elite martial artists of the
[Anti-Slavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink"). They can be found patrolling
towns and areas controlled by the Anti-Slavers in small numbers. They
also join attacks on the player's base if the player earns their ire,
although they do so in small numbers.

Despite not being a [Jonin](Anti-Slaver_Jonin.md "wikilink"), they can be
stronger than their sabre-equipped counterparts because of their similar
stats, but much higher stat randomization.

There is an HQ variant that is only found in
[Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink")'s squad.

They have a 50% chance to have a bounty from the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) ranging from 1 to 4000 cats.

## Interactions

**Anti-Slaver (unarmed)** can accompany or bodyguard the player that
require a few conditions, but most require the player to be allied with
the Anti-Slavers.

If the player is responsible for killing or kidnapping
[Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink"), [](Emperor_Tengu.md), or [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink"), they
will bodyguard the player for 72 hours.

If [Lady Kana](Lady_Kana.md "wikilink"), [](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md) or [](Slave_Master_Haga.md) are not okay, they will bodyguard
the player for 72 hours.

If [Big Bo](Bo.md "wikilink") is in the squad, she will hail a squad of
Anti-Slavers who will then bodyguard the squad for 72 hours. If the
Anti-Slavers come across a KO'd squad, they will stick around and guard
them for 6 hours. Likewise, if the player is nearly KO'd, have a damaged
head, or broken arms or legs, they will guard the player for 6 hours and
will additionally give them a Basic First Aid Kit or a Skeleton Repair
Kit, depending on the race of who they target first.

They will also toss a ration pack to a starving player if they see them.

## Trivia

- Due to their massive stat randomization and high base stats certain
  races can spawn with stats past the max level achievable by leveling.
  Many of these skills can actually continue to level again due to how
  the experience curve works. This makes recruiting an Anti-Slaver
  extremely game breaking. The following races can spawn with "break"
  stats, and the max random stat they can spawn with. (Note not all
  stats over 100 can continue to level, all "combat" stats listed can
  but others will need more testing to verify. Not including Field Medic
  as it can go beyond 100 normally)
  - Scorchlander: 110 Dexterity, 120 Dodge, 108 Stealth.
  - Hive Prince: 120 Dexterity, 108 Lockpicking, 108 Stealth, 108
    Thievery.
  - Hive Worker Drone: 120 Dexterity, 108 Stealth, 108 Thievery.

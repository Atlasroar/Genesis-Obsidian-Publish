![](Clunknad_spanner.PNG "Clunknad_spanner.PNG")**Clunknad Spanner** is
the alleged skeleton wizard mentioned by [](Emperor_Tengu.md) as a part of a joke. The emperor also
gives the player a [Mystery Sack](Mystery_Sack.md "wikilink") in order to
identify themselves to the wizard that should help the player to kill
the notorious Grievewrath.

The dialogue with Tengu is satire, mocking traditional RPG quest
structure and the use of magic. Both of these NPCs are not present in
[Kenshi](Kenshi.md "wikilink"). The Mystery Sack is, however, very real.

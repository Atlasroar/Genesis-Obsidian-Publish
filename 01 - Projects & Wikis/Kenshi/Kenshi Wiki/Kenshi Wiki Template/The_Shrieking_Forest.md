**The Shrieking Forest** is a zone of dense vegetation located to the
North of the [Fog Islands](Fog_Islands.md "wikilink") and
[Obedience](Obedience.md "wikilink"), West of the
[Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink"), and south of the [](Purple_Sands.md). It is home to the [](Shrieking_Bandits.md) hence the name.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink"), [](Minor_Outposts.md), or Ancient Locations in The
Shrieking Forest. This zone does not spawn [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or
Camps.

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

## Environment

The natives here are quite territorial and their endless horde will
never allow you take their fertile land that pretty much allows most
types of crops at 100% fertility. [Prospecting](Prospecting.md "wikilink")
reveals little mineral resources but there are spots that allows for
stone production at 100% quality. The place is really beautiful and
bountiful but all that screaming day and night really turns any sane man
off.

### Weather

*This zone has 2 seasons. Seasons may cause harmful [](Weather_Effects.md) or be purely aesthetic.*

- Wet forest -main
- Drifting-foliage

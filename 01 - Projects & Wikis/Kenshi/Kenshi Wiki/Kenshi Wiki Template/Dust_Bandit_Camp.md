**Dust Bandit Camps** are randomly spawning camps. They can spawn in the
[Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink"), [Shem](Shem.md "wikilink"), and
[Skinner's Roam](Skinner's_Roam.md "wikilink").

This location spawns [Camp Beds](Camp_Bed.md "wikilink") which the player
can use for free. Looting items from the camp after its occupants have
been defeated will wipe it off the map.

**Crab Shoes** is Heavy Armour that is equipped in the Footwear slot. It
is the only faction-specific footwear that can be found in game and it
can be crafted once the blueprint is purchased from
[them](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink"). It is part of a Crab Armour "set"
together with [Crab Helmet](Crab_Helmet.md "wikilink"), [](Crab_Armour.md) (body) and [](Crab_Trousers.md).

This armour has inventory dimensions of **2x4**.

## Appearance

**Crab Shoes** are, as the description entails, a pair of iron shoes.
They don't look much like crab feet, but they do go well with the other
parts of the Crab Armour outfit.

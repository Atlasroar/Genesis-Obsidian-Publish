**Heng** is the home of the [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink"),
eponymously named after a major city in this region. Being the heartland
of the trade and commerce of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), this zone is teeming with a large
amount of slave and mercantile convoys both domestic and
[foreign](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") to the UC, alongside mercenaries,
bounty hunters, manhunters and slavehunters seeking to make a fortune
(or at least a living), some of them will do it by any means neccessary,
even if it means to raid strangers for profit. Naturally, this zone is
also teeming with the less fortunate and downtrodden masses, escapees
and rebels many of whom are just as equally opportunistic to any
wandering strangers as the aforementioned folks.

Truly a land of opportunity, any player has their chance on kicking
their pot of gold or wearing fancy clothing -- just as they have the
chance of kicking their bucket or wearing slave attire in the wild
civilization of United Cities here. Depending on their luck and prowess,
they can either find the sweet or bitter end of the deals that the
empire has to offer.

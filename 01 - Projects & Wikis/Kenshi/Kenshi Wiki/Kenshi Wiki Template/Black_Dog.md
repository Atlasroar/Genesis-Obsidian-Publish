## Trivia

- The faction name "Black Dog" could be a combination of "Blackguard"
  and "Watch dog", which refers to both their tendency to betray and
  bite the hand that feeds them and their job as a mercenary/bodyguard,
  respectively. Alternatively, it may also be referring to their
  black-themed armor and their utilization of Bonedogs.

**Fancy Rug** is a [trade good](Trade_Goods.md "wikilink") found on the
floors of the luxurious [Noble Houses](Noble_House.md "wikilink"). It can
be picked up from the floor with an "Alt+left click". Since Fancy Rugs
are only found in possession of the nobles, such an act is always
[theft](Thievery.md "wikilink"), at least at first. A **Fancy Rug** can be
placed back on the floor by simply dragging it out of the inventory of a
character. [Simple Rugs](Simple_Rug.md "wikilink") work much in the same
way, but are also available for purchase in some places.

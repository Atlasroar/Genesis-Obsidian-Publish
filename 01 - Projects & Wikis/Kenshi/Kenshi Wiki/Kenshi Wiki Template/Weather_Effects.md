Weather happens in Kenshi quite often and can have certain **Weather
Effects**. These Weather Effects can damage characters, or simply
detract from their [Statistics](Statistics.md "wikilink").
[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") and animals are never affected by
weather. Weather Effects can be affected by changing
[Seasons](Seasons_and_Weather.md "wikilink").

## Acid Rain

![](AcidRain1.png "AcidRain1.png") **Acid Rain** is a form of weather
that occurs in polluted zones. In addition to wearing clothing which
protects from Acid Rain, characters can build tents in order to hide
from it. Entering any building will also protect characters from Acid
Rain.

Acid Rain protection does nothing to protect from swimming in acidic
water. When traveling through the [Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink"),
[Iron Valleys](Iron_Valleys.md "wikilink") or [](The_Black_Desert.md) characters which need Acid
protection will also need shoes, because the ground itself is acidic and
will burn your legs if they are unprotected.

Characters which do not need Acid Rain protection are
[Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink"), [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink"), and all
types of [Animals](Fauna.md "wikilink"). Complete protection is not
required (80% is enough for you to regenerate faster than the damage it
deals) but characters will complain vocally until you have a protection
of 100%.

### Effect

When unprotected characters encounter Acid Rain, organic body parts will
slowly experience stun [Damage](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Damage.md "wikilink").

## Burning

![](Venge1.png "Venge1.png") **Burning** is a weather which exists in
[Venge](Venge.md "wikilink"). Characters who are traveling through the area
will see large, moving rays from an orbital station similar to the eye.
These beams will move pretty fast and last a few seconds (A few game
minutes) before disappearing. If a character is without protection and
in the ray for the entire duration, they may be severely injured. Even
if a beam visually disappears, it may still be active so take care when
moving through the path of where one once was.

### Effect

Any organic humanoid characters caught in these rays without protection
will experience brutal burns on all organic parts of their bodies. This
Weather Effect results in Cutting [Damage](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Damage.md "wikilink"). (It is
recommended that you immediately bandage up)

### Zones

- [Venge](Venge.md "wikilink")

### Protection

- [Armoured Hood](Armoured_Hood.md "wikilink") (25%)
- [Dustcoat](Dustcoat.md "wikilink") (80%)
- [Sleeveless Dustcoat](Sleeveless_Dustcoat.md "wikilink") (60%)
- [Crab Helmet](Crab_Helmet.md "wikilink") (60%)
- [Crab Armour](Crab_Armour.md "wikilink") (50%)

## Dust Storms

![](Duststorm1.png "Duststorm1.png")
![](DustStorm2.png "DustStorm2.png") **Dust Storms** happen mostly in
desert regions and affect a character's accuracy when attacking. If
characters do not have Dust Storm protection, they will hold an arm up
to cover their eyes. This animation does not negate the effect which the
Dust Storm causes.

### Effect

When a character is entirely unprotected from Dust Storms, their [](Melee_Attack.md) and [](Martial_Arts.md) are reduced by up to 10.
[Perception](Perception.md "wikilink") and [](Precision_Shooting.md) are reduced by up to 33.5%.
Storms can range in strength up to 1.0. (Which results in the maximum
stat penalties) Some areas have weaker Dust Storms which result in less
stat loss.

Dust Storms are also great for sneaking as during one the vision range
of units is reduced.

### Zones

## Gas

![](Gas1.png "Gas1.png") **Gas** is the second most rare Weather
Effects. In the zones where this occurs, players see a cloud moving
across the nearby area. In the Black Desert the clouds are small and
black, while the Ashlands has larger white clouds. The Black Desert
clouds do more damage than the ones in the Ashlands. The time it takes
to go from (On a Greenlander) 100 health to 0 in the Black Desert clouds
is 13 minutes game time. For the Ashlands clouds it takes 19 minutes.

### Effect

When unprotected characters walk through Gas clouds, they experience
stun [Damage](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Damage.md "wikilink") to their Chest. (Sometimes stomach)

### Zones

- [The Black Desert](The_Black_Desert.md "wikilink")
- [Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink")

### Protection

- [Fog Mask](Fog_Mask.md "wikilink") (100%)
- [Mask Type III](Mask_Type_III.md "wikilink") (100%)
- [Swamp Ninja Mask](Swamp_Ninja_Mask.md "wikilink") (100%)
- [Swamp Ninja Rags](Swamp_Ninja_Rags.md "wikilink") (20%) it's the only
  gas protection for [](Hive_Soldier_Drone.md)

## Tips

- When inside buildings you are immune to all weather effects.
- When on the top floor of a building you are immune to Gas and Burning
  damage.
- Your damage resistance from Toughness has no impact on the damage
  taken from weather effects.
- Sometimes when loading a save the game will not register that you are
  indoors or under shelter for a short time leading to damage being
  taken when you should be protected. The damage taken should be minimal
  and non-lethal before the game catches up.

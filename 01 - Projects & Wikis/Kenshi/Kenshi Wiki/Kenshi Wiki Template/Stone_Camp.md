**Stone Camp** is a town in [](The_Great_Desert.md) which is controlled by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md). It lies directly on the path and
nearly half-way between [Stoat](Stoat.md "wikilink") and
[Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink"). Stone Camp is essentially a slave
worker camp where slaves toil in many [](Stone_Mine.md). This location is home to [](Slave_Master_Haga.md). It can be discovered by reading the
**[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the United Cities (Central Territories)**.

Despite featuring buildings labeled "[](Slaver_Bar.md)", there is no vendor in these 'bars' and
therefore [slave recruits](Slave_Recruits.md "wikilink") do not spawn.

There is also another stone camp, called the [](South_Stone_Camp.md) located in
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"). It is controlled by [](Slave_Master_Ruben.md).

[Port North](Port_North.md "wikilink") and [](Port_South.md) on the fringes of the Great Desert can
also technically be qualified as Stone camps.

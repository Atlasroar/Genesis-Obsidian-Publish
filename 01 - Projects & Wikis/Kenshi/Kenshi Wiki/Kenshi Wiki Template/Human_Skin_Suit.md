**Human Skin Suit** is a [Body Armour](Body_Armour.md "wikilink") worn by
[Skin Bandits](Skin_Bandits.md "wikilink").

It is the perfect non-disguise, but somehow the
[fleshies](Human.md "wikilink") can tell that you are a skeleton.

Because for every good thing there has to be another good thing, the
Skin Bandits also store another type of [](Human_Skin.md) clothing.

## Appearance

Just humans being humans, doing normal human things.

We are not sure why it's a separate item, all humans have one so they
can do normal human things like breathing through their nostrils,
singing human songs, and eating human fue- food.

If anyone can shine light on this mystery please contribute.

## Crafting

The suit blueprint could be found in [](Skinhouse_HQ.md) and the other
[Skinhouses](Skinhouse.md "wikilink") in earlier game versions but has now
been removed. Instead, the Skeleton-Human Transformation Bible blueprint
found on [Savant](Savant.md "wikilink") now grants crafting of the suit as
well as the [Peeler Machine](Peeler_Machine.md "wikilink").

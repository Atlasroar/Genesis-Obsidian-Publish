**Samurai** **Police** are law enforcers for the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md), and the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Free_Traders.md). This branch of Samurai operate out of
[Police Stations](Police_Station.md "wikilink") and are mainly responsible
for protecting urban centers, while standard
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink") perform military duties such as
patrolling.

As law enforcement, Samurai Police carry blunt jittes instead of the
typical katanas.

Inside of Police Stations, a [Police Chief](Police_Chief.md "wikilink")
resides, giving bounty notices, offering bails, and acting as a merchant
for reselling confiscated items.

Despite the loosening of the United Cities' grip on the southern
territories after certain [World States](World_States.md "wikilink") are
achieved, they still seem to assume the role of law enforcement in the
cities. This may be due to the lack of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md) presence in the south, leaving
security to be handled by the Police and [](Tech_Hunter_Gate_Guard.md).

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

**Tech Hunter Ruins** are randomly named members of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) faction. They can be found patrolling
[Forbidden Isle](Forbidden_Isle.md "wikilink"), [](Leviathan_Coast.md), and [Shun](Shun.md "wikilink") in
groups of 1-5 characters.

They have a 4% chance to spawn with a bounty ranging from 1 to 4000
Cats.

If this character is found alone, there is a chance the player can
recruit them as a bodyguard for a day.

## Interactions

Tech Hunter Ruins that are found near ruins can be talked to. Listening
to them and claiming the player has had luck with scavenging can prompt
them to ask to join you. Accepting results in them bodyguarding the
player for 24 hours.

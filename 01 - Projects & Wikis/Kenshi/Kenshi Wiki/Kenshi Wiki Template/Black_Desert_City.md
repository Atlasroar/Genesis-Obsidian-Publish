**Black Desert City** is a Town run by [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink")
in the middle of the [Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink") region. As there
are no human residents, the town lacks a food supply as is noted by the
town’s bartender, however edible food can be found in containers within
the other buildings. There are regular beds and skeleton repair beds on
the second floor of the bar. This town was created after the fall of the
[Second Empire](Second_Empire.md "wikilink") (spoilers!).
[Sadneil](Sadneil.md "wikilink") can be recruited in this location.

Fighting with the locals is not advised. Like guards/police of other
cities, you will be carried outside after being knocked unconscious. Due
to the region's [Acid Rain](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink"), this can be
dangerous for any characters which are not Hivers or Skeletons.

Just outside the city, there is a bridge which connects to the hill
where the [Scraphouse](Scraphouse.md "wikilink") is located.

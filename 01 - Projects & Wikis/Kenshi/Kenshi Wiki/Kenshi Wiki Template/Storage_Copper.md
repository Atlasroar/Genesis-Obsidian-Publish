The **Storage: Copper** is a [Storage](Storage.md "wikilink") container
which exclusively contains [Copper](Copper.md "wikilink"). Players can
construct this building after researching [Storage Boxes: Ore
(Tech)](Storage_Boxes:_Ore_(Tech) "wikilink").

This container can hold a total of 100 items.

**NOTE:** The characters will auto-haul into the storage when they
assigned to care for a Mine. Make sure when you set multiple tasks for a
character, hauling into the storage is the last thing on they list, or
at least hauling into a storage is after they put the material into
machines. Otherwise they will go back-and-forth between the two
buildings.

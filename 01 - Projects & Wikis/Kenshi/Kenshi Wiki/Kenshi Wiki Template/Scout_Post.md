There are two **Scout Posts.** Both are on the border of [](Hidden_Forest.md) and [](Cannibal_Plains.md) regions. One of them is led by
[Mani](Mani.md "wikilink") who will trade you anything inside if you talk
him into it. Both Posts are occupied by a few [](Flotsam_Ninja.md) who are capable of stopping some
groups of [Scrawny Cannibals](Scrawny_Cannibal.md "wikilink"), but are
likely to falter if met with larger forces or their stronger brothers
[Cannibals](Cannibal.md "wikilink"), as well as other bigger threats such
as [Shrieking Bandits](Shrieking_Bandits.md "wikilink"),
[Berserkers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink") and especially a group of [](Beak_Thing.md) that wander around this zone from time to
time.

**Error Code 0xFFFFFF** are skeletons found exclusively in the
[Reprogramming Workshop](Reprogramming_Workshop.md "wikilink"). They are
members of the [Broken Ones](Broken_Ones.md "wikilink") faction. They will
become allies with the player upon discovery.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

## Interactions

Once the Error Code bots see the player (not sneaking), they will
immediately follow the character around as bodyguards almost
permanently. They will indiscriminately attack most targets they see, be
they enemies or neutral factions. (Excluding many neutral wildlife)

Talking to any Error Code bot will be given a single line of dialogue,
along with the bot turning towards the character.

## Tips

- Once they are allied, the bots will allow themselves to be picked up
  by player characters after a short time. This will bring two
  advantages that makes these characters invaluable. First, they allow
  themselves to be placed in [Prisoner Cages](Prisoner_Cage.md "wikilink"),
  creating a "jack-in-the-box" kind of reserve military force. Being
  caged also keeps them away from neutral characters that these bots
  could otherwise attack. Second, once picked up, the bots can be
  equipped with new armour, weapons, and repair kits significantly
  extending their survivability and usefulness.
- You need to save and then load your save after giving one a repair kit
  in order for them to be used (if you are playing an organic character
  be sure to also give them first aid kits to help patch you up when
  injured).
- If the character they are following is sneaking they (mostly) don't
  attack everything around you. This can be extremely helpful for
  traveling longer distances to avoid losing many of your Error Codes.
- As NPCs do not consume charges you can equip them with crossbows and a
  single bolt to create a massive firing squad.
- They will instantly get off of a Skeleton Repair Bed if placed in one.
  So if you wish to heal the wear damage of an Error Code you may pick
  one up and drop them on the ground. This will KO the Error Code for a
  short time. Simply pick the unit back up and place in a Skeleton
  Repair bed. Repeat if needed until the wear damage is healed.

## Trivia

- 0xFFFFFF is the Hex Code for the color white.

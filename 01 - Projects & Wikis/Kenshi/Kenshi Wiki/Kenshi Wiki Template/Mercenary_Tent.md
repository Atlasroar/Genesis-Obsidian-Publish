**Mercenary Tents** are [Camping](Camping.md "wikilink")
[buildings](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") which the player can construct
anywhere after learning the blueprint. They require very few materials
in order to construct and do not result in the creation of a player
town. Camps can be used as a quick shelter from acid rain.

They can also be placed, for decoration, on the roof of the buildings
you own. If placed and then destroyed, a reload is required to be able
to place them on the roof again.

The blueprint can be purchased from any of these locations:

- [Adventurer Bar](Adventurer_Bar.md "wikilink")
- [Flats Lagoon Bar](Flats_Lagoon_Bar.md "wikilink")
- [Shark Travel Shop](Shark_Travel_Shop.md "wikilink")
- [Tech Hunter Shop](Tech_Hunter_Shop.md "wikilink")
- [Travel and Repairs Shop](Travel_and_Repairs_Shop.md "wikilink")
- [Travel Gear](Travel_Gear.md "wikilink")

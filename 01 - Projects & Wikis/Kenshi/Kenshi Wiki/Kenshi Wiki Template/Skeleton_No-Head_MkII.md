![](Skeleton-NoHead.png "Skeleton-NoHead.png") **Skeleton No-Head
MkII,** or Thralls, are a [Race](Races.md "wikilink") in Kenshi. They are a
subrace of [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink"). There are no [](Playable_Characters.md) which are of this race. Most
Thralls are not able to speak intelligibly.

Apparently lacking a head has really weakened this race as they have the
lowest Vision Range of any Skeleton. On top of that any debuffs which
are applied from head injuries are permanently treated as if the
Skeleton No-Head MKII has 0% health (so they will always suffer from
-45% Robotics). As a bit of a tradeoff, they have a bonus of
melee-related combat skills; Blunt Weapons, Heavy Weapons and Melee
Attack. They are the only race to have 2 Weapon skill bonuses, even
having one is rare.

## Lore

It is highly implied from several sources including dialogue with
Cat-Lon that thralls are either jury-rigged or lobotomised skeletons.
The former theory can be gathered from the skeleton shredders within the
tower of abuse and the latter can be gleamed from Cat-Lon's speech
before initiating combat.

## Trivia

- In real life, the word Thrall is a Scandinavian word for "slave or
  serf" during the Viking Age. Today, to *enthrall*means to captivate
  but archaically it means to capture as a slave.
- The missing Head counts as an Injury, giving a 56.25% penalty to all
  crafting tasks.
- While most of Skeletons possess the sturdy 200 HP body model, Thralls
  are among the only models that have 120HP bodies. It can be assumed
  that the weaker, perhaps service-oriented or creative-minded, skeleton
  models were enthralled en-masse by their sturdier cousins after the
  fall of the ancient empires.

The **Black Dragon Ninjas** are a [faction](Factions.md "wikilink") of
ninjas that engage in protection rackets, pillaging the outposts that do
not pay them. They reside in a tower located in the [](Border_Zone.md). As of the current update, they are
[hostile](Hostile_Factions.md "wikilink") and will attack if a player
approaches the [Tower of Ninjas](Tower_Of_Ninjas.md "wikilink"). They also
have roaming squads in [Stobe's Garden](Stobe's_Garden.md "wikilink") with
a very low chance of spawning.

The Black Dragon Ninjas are led by [Dimak](Dimak.md "wikilink") and
[Buzan](Buzan.md "wikilink"), both of which reside in the tower. The tower
also contains at least 10 [](Black_Dragon_Genin.md).

The Black Dragon Ninjas will [attack](Bandit_Raid.md "wikilink") the
player's [outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") if it is
within 4500 meters from the Tower of Ninjas and Dimak is alive.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

## Trivia

- Originally, there was a faction that was called '[](White_Eyebrow_Clan.md)" that existed before it was cut
  and it was hostile to **Black Dragon Ninjas**, so it is likely that
  these two factions were originally set to be warring rivals.
- The Black Dragon Ninjas may be a reference to The Black Dragon
  Fighting Society, a real world kung-fu dojo in Chicago in the 1970s.
  The Dojo boasts the Dim Mak kung-fu style and in the game the leader
  of the ninjas is named Dimak. The Dojo is infamous for its involvement
  in the Chicago Dojo Wars of the 1970s. It is also famous for its
  eccentric founder Count Raphael Dante.

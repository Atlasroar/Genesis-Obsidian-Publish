![](Flophouse.jpg "Flophouse.jpg")\]\] A Flophouse is a type of building
that is found in almost all cities in [Old World](Old_World.md "wikilink").
A Flophouse, also referred to as an inn, is a place where you can rent
beds for 100 cats so your characters can sleep and recover health. It is
also possible to place NPCs at Flophouses to rest. There is no charge
for placing NPCs in a Flophouse bed. 

The establishment is always run by an NPC named [](Mr._Floppy.md). If you interact with the counter Mr.
Floppy stands behind you can purchase first aid kits. 

Flophouses are not removed from the game entirely, however. Despite not
being set to spawn anywhere, the unique recruit
[Horse](Horse.md "wikilink") requests that the player pay his bill at a
flophouse.

## Tips and Tricks

- When raiding, doing so at night is often better, as many rebels are
  inside the barracks sleeping and will not be aggroed outside of the
  buildings (except for the swamp huts).
- Make sure that you have a decent number of men and weaponry before
  attacking, as what the rebels lack in skill and gear they make up with
  numbers.
- Bring enough first aids kits for both your men, and any prisoners you
  chose to capture, as [Boss Simion](Boss_Simion.md "wikilink") has a 20k
  bounty, and each of his captains are worth around 3k.
- You are able to steal from the Barracks (Not the Faction HQ) without
  getting in trouble. You can constantly steal from the containers by
  putting stuff inside and taking it out (Stacking items work best along
  with shift-clicking to try to steal the entire stack back) and putting
  it back in. Rinse and repeat.

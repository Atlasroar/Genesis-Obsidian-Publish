**Chad**is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink") that can be
found in the Bar of [Flats Lagoon](Flats_Lagoon.md "wikilink"). He spawns
with no weapon and claims to have traveled into the south-eastern part
of the map, encountering [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") and
escaping after punching one in the nose. You can recruit him for 9,000
Cats.

He has a Dumb [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink"). Aside from his
recruitment dialogue, Chad has nothing unique to say. It has also been
noted that upon attacking [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink")
guards they will recognize Chad if Chad is among the attacking party.

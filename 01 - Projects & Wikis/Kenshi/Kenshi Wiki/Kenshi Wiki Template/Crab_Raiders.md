**Crab Raiders** are a faction of
[Scorchlanders](Scorchlander.md "wikilink") who worship
[Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink"). They will host a "[](Crab_Tournament.md)" at a player outpost in order to
determine if you are worthy enough to own crabs as well and become crab
master. Like other "pit gang" factions, they often time engage in border
raids and skirmishes with their rivals and share hostility towards
[United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"). They will also
[raid](Crabbed_Ones.md "wikilink") the [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md), unless allied.

Note: Player can buy a crab at a Crab shop without being allied to them
or doing a tournament. The player cannot, however, buy their [](Crab_Armour.md) without being allied.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

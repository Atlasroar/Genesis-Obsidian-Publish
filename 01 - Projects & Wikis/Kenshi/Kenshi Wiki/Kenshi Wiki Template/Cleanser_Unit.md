## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which Cleanser
Units have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

## Spawns

### Regions

There is only one squad which the Cleanser Unit can spawn in. Multiple
squads can be spawned in simultaneously in different parts of the
Ashlands.

### Spawn Groups

The squad "robo levi" spawns a single Cleanser Unit between the age of
0.65 to 0.9.

## Trivia

- The Cleanser Unit may actually be an inspiration taken from the
  Leviathans, as the only squad which Cleanser Units can spawn in is
  named in the FCS as "robo levi".

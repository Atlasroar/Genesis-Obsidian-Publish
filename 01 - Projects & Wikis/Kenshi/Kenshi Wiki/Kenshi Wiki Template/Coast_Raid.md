**Coast Raid** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a base within 5,000 meters of a
[Fishmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink") owned location. It has a 15% chance to
trigger each day if within 3,500 meters, this chance scales down with
distance until it reaches 0% at 5,000 meters. The event cannot trigger
if the [King Gurgler](King_Gurgler.md "wikilink") is killed or captured.

Once the conditions are fulfilled, the [Fishmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink")
will send an assault to the player's base. This assault will consist of
2-4 squads, each consisting of 20-40 [Gurglers](Gurgler.md "wikilink") and
0-3 [Alpha Gurglers](Alpha_Gurgler.md "wikilink").

arrives, the War Leader will shout a few times before the assault
begins, breaking down gates and attacking characters.

**Note:** As of 1.0.64, this event is currently broken and cannot
trigger without a mod fixing it, due to the faction having a "not real"
faction flag.

**Raid** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 5,000 meters of
the [Exile Camp](Exile_Camp.md "wikilink"). It has a 20% chance to trigger
if within 2,500 meters, this chance scales down with distance until it
hits 0% at 5,000 meters. The event cannot trigger if [](Tora_the_Fearless.md) is killed or captured, or if the
player has killed or captured [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md), the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), or the
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink").

Once the conditions are fulfilled, the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md) will send an assault to the player's
base. This assault will consist of 2-4 squads, each made up of 4-7 [](Band_of_Bones_(Character).md).
![](Raid_Range.jpg "Raid_Range.jpg") When the assault arrives, the War
Leader will give a short speech before ordering the attack to begin,
breaking down gates, attacking characters, and liberating captives. If
the assault is defeated, a [](Shek_Challengers_(Band_of_Bones).md) event will be
triggered in 80-120 hours. If the assault is victorious, another
**Raid** event will trigger in 200-300 hours.

The **Chalice Of Fire** is a [unique item](Unique_Items.md "wikilink")
given by [Holy Lord Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink") to the player
faction for showing considerable value to [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md).

You receive the Chalice of Fire (as well as a [](Holy_Seal.md) after more dialogue) from the Holy Lord
Phoenix as soon as your faction relation with The Holy Nation reaches
75.

From the icon, it looks just like a more polished and shinier version of
the luxury good called [Pearl Cup](Pearl_Cup.md "wikilink").

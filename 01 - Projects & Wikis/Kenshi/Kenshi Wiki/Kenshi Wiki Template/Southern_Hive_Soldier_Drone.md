![](SouthHive-Soldier.png "SouthHive-Soldier.png") **Southern Hive
Soldier Drones** are a [Race](Races.md "wikilink") in Kenshi. They are a
subrace of the Southern [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink").

Compared to their [Western Cousins](Hive_Soldier_Drone.md "wikilink"),
Southern Hive Soldier Drones don't have a -20% xp penalty on
[Perception](Perception.md "wikilink") skill.

Characters of this race can become [](Playable_Characters.md) when bought or freed from
[Slavery](Slavery.md "wikilink") provided they are not from the Southern
Hive faction. This is because the Southern Hive Faction Solder Drones
are either [Droneguard](Droneguard.md "wikilink") or [](Elite_Droneguard.md) or [](Armoury_Droneguard.md) all of which are tagged as
military characters meaning they cannot pass the '[is
recruitable](https://kenshi.fandom.com/wiki/Playable_Characters#'Is_Recruitable'_Tag)'
check. Further the Dialogue package 'npc HIVER Southern' does not
contain any dialogue that allows recruitment when bought or freed from
slavery or prison.

## Trivia

- <s>Theoretically, a Player Character of this race could possibly be
  obtained if a Southern Hive Soldier Drone was sold into slavery, then
  freed as a [Slave Recruit](Slave_Recruits.md "wikilink").</s> (although
  [slaves](Slave.md "wikilink") also have a chance of spawning as a member
  of this race)
- It is not possible to recruit Soldiers of Southern Hive on vanilla due
  to the fact that they will always spawn with stats too high and are
  tagged as military characters. The southern hive dialogue package also
  contains no chances for recruitment and they do not use or inherit any
  other dialogue package if they came from the southern hive.

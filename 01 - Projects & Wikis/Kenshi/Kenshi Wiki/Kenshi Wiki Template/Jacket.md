![](Jacket_Icon.png "Jacket_Icon.png")The**Jacket** is armor in [](Old_World.md) that can be used as a [](Body_Armour.md) for the player. As of 0.50.1 it
currently does not belong to any Armour Class and can only be purchased.
Currently the only way to obtain the Jacket is to buy it from an [](Armour_Trader.md).

Additionally there is a graphic glitch for characters wearing a Jacket.
The armour does not recognize the character's right arm so the jacket's
sleeve hangs loose not following whatever action is being performed.

## Appearance

![](Jacket.jpg "Jacket.jpg") The Jacket is a beige colored fabric jacket
that has leather reinforcing patches just above the shoulder on both
sides. The Jacket is held closed with a belt that wraps around the
character's waist.

## Interactions

When you find Garret, he is sitting with his slave by his side, treating
them to a bottle of [Sake](Sake.md "wikilink"). His fellow slave traders
seem confused by his decision to bring a slave into a bar. He responds
by saying his slave has been working hard, and deserves compensation as
"a happy slave makes a good slave".

His patrons mock this perspective, and imply that they seem like "[](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md) words". Garret then defuses the
situation by claiming his slave is only having a drink while carrying
his baggage, dismissing his previous thought altogether.

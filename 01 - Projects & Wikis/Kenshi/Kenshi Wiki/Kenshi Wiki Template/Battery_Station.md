**Battery Stations** are [small buildings](Small_Shack.md "wikilink") in
towns that house most, if not all, of the towns battery banks. They are
easily accessed by simply unlocking the door through
[Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink") and can even have small trinkets
in them such as small statues or rarely bread. Otherwise they are purely
aesthetic.

**Legion Thralls** are the main force of the [](Skeleton_Legion.md). They can be found patrolling the
[Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink") and in [](Ashland_Dome_I.md).

Although not having a head, this character appears to have an Old CPU
Unit in it's inventory, indicating that either the CPU Units isn't
stored in Skeleton's heads (or at least for this particular model). Or
that it's simply a developer oversight.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

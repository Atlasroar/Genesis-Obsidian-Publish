**Beds** is a Level II [Core Tech](Core_Tech.md "wikilink") which allows
the player to construct [Beds](Bed.md "wikilink").

This research is a must-have for all players, as even
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") characters can benefit from beds. Having
player-owned beds can save a small amount of Cats if [](Player-Owned_Buildings_in_Town.md) and can be the
difference between life and death for players who have built a secluded
[outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink").

**Fabric Manufacture** is [Crafting Tech](Crafting_Tech.md "wikilink")
which unlocks a [Fabric Loom](Fabric_Looms.md "wikilink") that converts
[Cotton](Cotton.md "wikilink") into [Fabrics](Fabrics.md "wikilink"). This
technology is not required for [](Hemp-Based_Fabric_(Tech).md), which unlocks the
[Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink") version of this building.

Players planning on making cotton-based fabrics should construct their
base in a Green [Environment](Environment.md "wikilink"), as there is no
[Hydroponics](Hydroponics.md "wikilink") building for Cotton.__NOTOC__

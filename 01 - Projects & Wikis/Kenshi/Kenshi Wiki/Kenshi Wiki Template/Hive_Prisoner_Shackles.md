**Hive Prisoner Shackles** are shackles specifically for
[Hive](Hive.md "wikilink") and [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") prisoners
since they do not have a boots slot and cannot have regular [](Prisoner_Shackles.md) equipped, as well as
[Human](Human.md "wikilink") or [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") characters who have
prosthetic legs. Though any character can wear them, regardless of race
or limb status. These shackles are instead equipped in the armour slot.
They have a lock level of 20 and a strength level of 20.

They may be used to train melee attack and defence but please note that
a character will be considered "enslaved" by the game once they equip
the shackles so one would have to deal with the whole escaped slave
mechanics after training.

This armour has inventory dimensions of **3x4**.

## Obtaining

Have one of your hiver or skeleton teammates be a slave and have them
pick their own shackles. Any other attempt at having someone else pick
shackles either to a teammate or some other slave just has them
disappear as soon as they are unlocked.

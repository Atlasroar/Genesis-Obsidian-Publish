**Gears** is an item which can often be found on the shelves of [](Trade_Goods_Trader.md) shops across Kenshi. They have no
function outside trade and due to their low value are considered a
[Junk](Junk.md "wikilink") item.

Given their abundance in Kenshi's world, one could speculate that they
are used by civilians and certain specialized engineers to fix broken
down manual/auto machineries.

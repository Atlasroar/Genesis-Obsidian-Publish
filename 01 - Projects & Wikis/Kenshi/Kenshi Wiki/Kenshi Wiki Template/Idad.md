Idad was an author that wrote the books [](Mass_Extinction_Series.md), [](Cultural_Groupings_And_Evolution_Series.md), [](The_Mystery_Of_Skeletech_Series.md),
[Legend of the Grievewraith](Legends_Series.md "wikilink"), [](Legends_Series.md), and [](Legends_Series.md). Little is known about Idad since Idad
doesn't exist as an NPC that players can interact with, however, it's
likely that Idad was a [Machinist](Machinists.md "wikilink") and that Idad
is possibly dead (hence the lack of an NPC).

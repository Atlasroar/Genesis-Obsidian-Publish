Game breaking (mandatory) animation names marked in **bold**.
Co-animations marked with \*. Animations that are used to interact with
objects will crash the game if they do not exist. But fluff animations
such as fighting, where physics is not involved can just be ignored. The
co-animations are a bit different, cause the game basically calls one of
them to play constantly, so lacking them will cause issues.

Known animation strips you can just have single frame pose are in
*italics.*

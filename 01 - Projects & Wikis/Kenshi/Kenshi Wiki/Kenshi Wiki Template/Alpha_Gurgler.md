**Alpha Gurglers** are the stronger and more skilled kin of
[Gurglers](Gurgler.md "wikilink"). They can be found patrolling alongside
their fellow [Fishmen](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink") on [](Fishman_Island.md) south of [Catun](Catun.md "wikilink").

Unlike their weaker [brethren](Gurgler.md "wikilink"), Alpha Gurglers can
stand toe to toe with most enemies due to their far tougher limbs. The
limb toughness and blood count of an Alpha Gurgler is double that of a
normal [Gurgler](Gurgler.md "wikilink"). Like the other
[Fishmen](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink") they use their Claws to fight in combat
using [Martial Arts](Martial_Arts.md "wikilink").

**Slave Raid** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 4,000 meters of a
[Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink") owned location. It has a 15%
chance to trigger each day if within 2,500 meters, this chance scales
down with distance until it reaches 0% at 4,000 meters. It cannot
trigger if the player is allied with the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), [](Traders_Guild.md), or [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md).

Once the conditions are fulfilled, the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) will send an assault to the player's
base. This assault will consist of 2-3 squads, each made up of 0-1
[Slaver Heavy Guard](Slaver_Heavy_Guard.md "wikilink"), 7-14 [](Slaver_Caravan_Guard.md), and led by a [](Slaver_Caravan_Boss.md).
![](Slave_Raid_Range.jpg "Slave_Raid_Range.jpg") Once the assault
arrives, and the War Leader will give a short speech. If the player's
outpost is level 3 (the full town icon), and the player has more than 15
characters in their squad, the raid will instead turn around and leave.
Otherwise, they will order the attack to begin, attacking gates and
characters, and capturing characters as slaves. Captured characters will
be brought to a slave mine or farm, where they will be put to work as
slave labour.

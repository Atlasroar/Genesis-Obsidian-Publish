**Eyegore's Assault** (also shown in-game as "Eyegore Assault" instead)
is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if the player has
killed or kidnapped [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink"),
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink"), or as a retaliation for defeating the
[Elite Hunter Assault](Elite_Hunter_Assault.md "wikilink") event. In the
scenario of a Tengu trigger, it will have a 200% chance to trigger each
day anywhere on the map, as its range is more than 3x the size of the
map. For a Longen trigger, it will have a 50% chance to trigger within
5,000 meters, and the chance will scale down with distance until it
reaches 0% chance at 11,000 meters.

Killing or capturing [Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink") will stop the events
from being triggered. In addition, killing or capturing [](Emperor_Tengu.md), [Lord Inaba](Lord_Inaba.md "wikilink"),
[Lord Nagata](Lord_Nagata.md "wikilink"), [](Lord_Yoshinaga.md), [](Lady_Sanda.md), and [Lady Tsugi](Lady_Tsugi.md "wikilink")
will stop the Longen or Tengu triggered variants.

Once triggered, the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") or
[Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink") will launch an assault on the
player's base. The forces making up the assault will differ depending on
the trigger. The Tengu triggered assault will consist of 3-9 squads, a
Longen triggered assault will consist of 2 squads, and a retaliation
trigger will consist of 2-4 squads.

The first squad will be led by [Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink"),
accompanied by 10 [Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), 1 [](Samurai_Scout.md), 1 [](Samurai_Captain.md), 3 [](Samurai_Heavy.md), and 2 [](Samurai_Sergeant.md). The remaining squads have two
possible variants they can spawn as. The first and most common one being
led by a [Samurai Sergeant](Samurai_Sergeant.md "wikilink"), accompanied by
1-3 [Samurai Scouts](Samurai_Scout.md "wikilink"), 10-15
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), and 8-20 [](Samurai_Conscript.md). The second being led by a
[Samurai Sergeant](Samurai_Sergeant.md "wikilink"), accompanied by 1-3
[Samurai Scouts](Samurai_Scout.md "wikilink"), 5-8
[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), and 1-4 [](Samurai_Conscript.md).

Once the assault arrives Eyegore and his Samurai will have a short
conversation, usually differing depending on the trigger source or
faction relations. And then Eyegore and his soldiers will attack. If
victorious, the assault should leave the base shortly afterward. If
defeated and it was a Longen or Tengu trigger, there will be a 40%
chance to trigger an [](Elite_Hunter_Assault.md) in 24-72 hours. If it was a
retaliation trigger, nothing else will trigger.

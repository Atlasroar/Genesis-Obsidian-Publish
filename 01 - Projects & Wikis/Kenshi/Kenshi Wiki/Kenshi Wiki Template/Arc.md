**Arc** is a legendary swordsman, and the leader of the
[Mongrel](Mongrel_(Faction).md "wikilink") faction. He is located in the
[HQ](Mongrel_HQ.md "wikilink") in [Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink") and has
[Diplomatic Status](Diplomatic_Status.md "wikilink").

Aside from being apparently renowned for his skills with the sabre,
there is not much else known about him, neither his past nor why he
leads the people of Mongrel.

Despite being the leader of Mongrel, he is not tied to any world states.

## Trivia

- Despite being renowned for sabre skills, technically Arc is
  well-versed in any type of melee weapon. This may have been the result
  of the FCS's mechanical make up.

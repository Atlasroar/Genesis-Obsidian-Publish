![](Prayer_Day_Range.jpg "Prayer_Day_Range.jpg") **Prayer Day** is an
[Event](Events.md "wikilink") which occurs when the player outpost is
within 2,000 meters of a [Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")
location, and not within a no-go zone. Its initiating event will have up
to a 50% chance each day of triggering, if you are based 1,500 meters or
closer to a Holy Nation owned location. The chance will scale down with
distance, reaching 0% chance at 2,000 meters or more.

It consists of a squad of 5 [High Paladins](High_Paladin.md "wikilink") and
4 [Holy Servants](Holy_Servant.md "wikilink") led by a [](Holy_Priest.md), the last of which will require an
audience. Itâ€˜s recommended to speak with the priest with a male Human
with a copy of [The Holy Flame](The_Holy_Flame.md "wikilink") book on his
inventory. In case of lacking one, the priest will provide a copy the
very first time for free. This limit is per game, not character.

If ignored for long enough, or if the interaction goes poorly, they will
leave and a [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Minor).md) will be launched 36 to
48 hours afterward. In some cases, if the player speaks the prayer
incorrectly or attacks the priest, they will assault the base and the
[Holy Nation Assault (Minor)](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Minor).md "wikilink")
will be launched 12 to 24 hours after.

If all the available characters are female (even if they are female
Greenlanders), the priest will say the following lines.

> "Woman, are there no men to speak with me?
>
> Wait... are there no men on this outpost? It is against sacred law to
> take up residence without brotherly guidance...
>
> This will not do... This will not do at all. You are not welcome
> here... you will be removed."

The priest and his squad will then leave and a [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Minor).md) will be launched in 12
to 36 hours. There are no dialogue options available to the player
during this conversation, and having a copy of "The Holy Flame" on the
character that talks to the Prayer Day leader makes no difference.

It's also worth noting that if a non-human interacts with the priest,
they will leave and a [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Minor).md) will be launched in 10
to 20 hours.

As soon as the Prayer Day is done another one should appear on the
"Events" page, and will launch in 100 to 160 hours. This event will stop
happening if any of the following is true: you are an enemy of the Holy
Nation, you are allied with either the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) or the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md), or if the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) has been killed or imprisoned.

Arguably, out of all of the major factions, the Prayer Day is the least
damaging of Tax Events to a player, as the Holy Nation only takes the
player's time. The [Shek Kingdom](Tribute_Round.md "wikilink") and the
[United Cities](Tax_Man_Visit.md "wikilink") hurt the player in more
substantial ways.

Like most tax Events, if the campaign is defeated by a third party
faction like bandits or wild animals on the way to the player's outpost,
it will prevent any future tax visits from the faction until the
player's next import. This is due to the long repeat limit timer, and
the fact that it doesn't consider being defeated by a third party as the
player killing them. This can be exploited by purposefully luring
hostiles to the event's forces while they en route to the player's base.

The **Deadlands,** one of the most polluted zones in the game, is home
to the [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") faction in their town of Black
Desert City as well as the Scraphouse next to it. Constant acid rain,
[acid ground](Acid_Ground.md "wikilink"), dark weather, and dead
environment defines this gloomy area, with multiple iron spiders
scattered across the entire area, both active and not. It is a hard zone
to settle or to traverse for an unprepared group, but it is a perfect
place for a large and technologically-advanced community to hide from
the [Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"), and to isolate themselves
from others.

## Inhabitants

This zone does not spawn [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps.

### Major Towns

- [Black Desert City](Black_Desert_City.md "wikilink")

### Minor Outposts

*These locations are typically small towns, villages, or faction bases.*

- [Scraphouse](Scraphouse.md "wikilink")

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Armoury Ruin](Armoury_Ruin.md "wikilink")
- [Deadland Workshop](Deadland_Workshop.md "wikilink") x3
- [Lost Armoury](Lost_Armoury.md "wikilink") x3

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

- [Iron Spiders](Iron_Spider.md "wikilink")

## Environment

This location has [Acid Ground](Acid_Ground.md "wikilink") as well as many
Acid Lakes.

### Weather

*This zone has the 'deadlands' season. Seasons may cause harmful
[Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") or be purely aesthetic.*

- Heavy Rain deadlands: This is acidic rain which occasionally has a
  lightning bolt effect.
- Despite the heavy rain, rain collectors will not capture any water,
  this is likely due to it being acid rain though (which doesn't really
  explain why farms can still be watered).
- There is no wind in the deadlands so any base must be powered by
  generators.

## Tips

- You will need really good acid protection to stay alive for long
  periods of time in this area if you bring a Human or a Shek there:
  - Rain protection: [Iron Hat](Iron_Hat.md "wikilink") or [](Ashland_Hat.md), [Longcoat](Longcoat.md "wikilink"),
    [Sleeveless Longcoat](Sleeveless_Longcoat.md "wikilink"),
    [Dustcoat](Dustcoat.md "wikilink"), or [](Sleeveless_Dustcoat.md)
  - Ground protection: wear boots or [](Wooden_Sandals.md)
  - Avoid swimming in Acid Lakes.
  - Build [Tents](Tents.md "wikilink") when you need resting in the wild.
- Building a base in the area might be good late game because of the
  lack of active bandits. The only thing patrolling are single iron
  spiders. Although it should be noted that generators and hydroponics
  must be used.
- Only [Humans](Human.md "wikilink") and [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") are
  affected by the acid rain and soil. [Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink"),
  [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") and animals are immune to acid, so
  they can safely pass through the region if they have enough common
  sense to avoid the [Iron Spiders](Iron_Spider.md "wikilink").
- Oddly enough, Hydroponic Farms placed on rooftops are permanently
  watered, eliminating the need for water imports/well runs from nearby
  zones meaning it is entirely possible to setup a functional and
  sustainable base.

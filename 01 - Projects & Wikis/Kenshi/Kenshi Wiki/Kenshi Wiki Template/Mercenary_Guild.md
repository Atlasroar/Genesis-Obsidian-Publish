The **Mercenary Guild**can be found in various cities and travelling
mainly diverse places.

They consist of many [Mercenaries](Mercenary.md "wikilink") and [](Mercenary_Heavy.md) following a [](Mercenary_Captain.md)who will loan themselves out as
bodyguards (c.2000 per day) or outpost protectors (c.1000 per day). They
are quite powerful, and can be very valuable for a low skilled squad
needing some protection. Contracts can be renewed by simply talking to
the leader of their squad again.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

## Trivia

- Despite its name, and the claim that it has become standard amongst
  their kind, no members of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Mercenary_Guild.md) wear [](Mercenary_Plate.md). A
  [mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2405404519)
  has been released that fixes this.

**Blooded Raid** is an [Event](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a base within 8,000 meters of a
location owned by the [Reavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink"). It has a 15% chance
to trigger each day if within 2,500 meters, this chance scales down with
distance until it reaches 0% chance at 8,000 meters. It cannot trigger
if [Valamon](Valamon.md "wikilink") is killed or captured, or if the player
is allied with the [Reavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink") (which is not possible
in vanilla without exploits).

Once the conditions are fulfilled the [Reavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink") will
send an assault to the player's base. This assault will consist of three
to five squads, each made up of 4-7 [](Reaver_Blooded.md) and 1-6 [](Reaver_Slave.md), led by a [](Reaver_Ironclad.md).

the leader will give a short speech and then order the attack. Breaking
down gates, attacking characters, and enslaving any downed characters.
Captured characters will be take to a [Reaver](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink") owned
location and imprisoned there.

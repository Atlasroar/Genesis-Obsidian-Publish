![](Adventurer.jpg "Adventurer.jpg") The Adventurers Guild was a
[faction](Factions_(Alpha).md "wikilink") from [](Old_World.md) which was introduced with version 0.58.3.
Named NPCs from the group can be found in random locations around the
map. Spotting of its members is most likely to occur near Cannibals
villages, where an adventurer was likely captured and carried into a
cage.

![](Clifford.jpg "Clifford.jpg") If rescued or encountered anywhere else
the member will behave similar to any other NPC. If talked to you will
get the typical response, "If you're looking to hire someone, try asking
around in bars." Left alone the adventurer will wander between shops
with the goal "shopping".

Adventurers also appear to be equipped with different gear and weapons
with no set uniform for the group.

**Sleeping Bags** can be created at a (Basic) [](Medical_Workbench.md) or bought from a [](Travel_Supplies_Shops.md).Â They are used as the only
ingredient in a [Camp Bed](Camp_Bed.md "wikilink") which can be placed via
the "Building menu". When the Camping Bed is dismantled a Sleeping Bag
is returned, allowing for it to be used again.

## Tips

Unlike other [medical items](Medical_Items.md "wikilink"), Sleeping Bags
are often neglected by adventurers. As evidenced by the item's
description, they can mean the difference between life and death in the
wilds. Take these with you!

## Trivia

- You can place sleeping bags on top of many other structures like
  Storage boxes, Small Research Benches, Beds and even Sleeping Bags
  themselves allowing you to make the most out of a small area.

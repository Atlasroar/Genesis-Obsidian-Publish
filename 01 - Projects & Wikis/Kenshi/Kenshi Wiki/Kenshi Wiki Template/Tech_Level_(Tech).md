**Tech Levels** serve as a gating mechanism to other
[Technologies](Technology.md "wikilink"). They ensure that a player must
research in tiers before reaching late game technological wonders such
as [Hydroponics](Hydroponics_(Tech).md "wikilink")Â or [](Automated_Mining_Tech_(Tech).md).

Players are required to begin their research with a [](Small_Research_Bench.md) at Tech Level I. Progression to
Tech Level II unlocks [Research Bench II](Research_Bench.md "wikilink"),
and so forth. These advancements are made by researching the next tier
and having the appropriate materials. [Books](Book.md "wikilink") are the
only requirement initially for many forms of research. Greater levels
require rarer items such as [](Ancient_Science_Book.md) or [](AI%20Core.md).

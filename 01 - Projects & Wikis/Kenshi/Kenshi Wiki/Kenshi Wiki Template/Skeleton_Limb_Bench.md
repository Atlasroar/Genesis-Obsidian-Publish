![](Screenshot_9.jpg "Screenshot_9.jpg") ​The **Skeleton Limb Bench** is
a crafting [Building](Buildings_List.md "wikilink"). This crafting station
allows players to craft [Robot Limbs](Robot_Limbs.md "wikilink") to replace
any lost appendages. It is unlocked with the [](Hiver_Skeleton_Legs_(Tech).md) research.

##  Skill Levels

The quality outcome for any crafted limbs is based on crafter's
[Robotics](Robotics.md "wikilink") level.

Just like [armourand](Armour_Smith.md "wikilink") [](Weapon_Smith.md), it is possible to crit a higher
grade level. At the moment, the critical chance can't be seen in queue
window but it has been observed a crafter with 80+ on robotics having a
masterwork quality as an outcome.

| Quality    | Level Range |
|------------|-------------|
| Prototype  | 0           |
| Shoddy     | 20          |
| Standard   | 40          |
| High       | 60          |
| Specialist | 80          |
| Masterwork |             |

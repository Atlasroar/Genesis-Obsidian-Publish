**Bloodrum** is a commodity which is made from combining [](Cactus_Rum.md) with [Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink"). It
cannot be crafted by the player.

It is considered a contraband item by [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) and [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md).

Large quantities can be looted from Smugglers (Grayflayers) in the Grey
Desert [Waystation](Waystation_(Grey_Desert).md "wikilink") area. Each
Smuggler carries two Bloodrum and ten units of
[Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- Many [United Cities](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") and [](Traders_Guild.md) nobles have Bloodrum in their
  inventory, despite it being illegal in their country.
- Although this alcohol is made out of illegal **Hashish**, it appears
  that this drink is legal both in [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

![](Shek.png "Shek.png")**Shek** are a [Race](Races.md "wikilink") of bony,
horned humanoids. It is the only race which does not have a related
subrace.

The Shek have a [culture](Lore.md "wikilink") that values pride,
honor, and physical strength—so much so that many would prefer to die in
a hopeless battle than continue living as a disgraced survivor. The Shek
are known for their steadfast stoicism and considerable absence of humor
when compared to the more jovial races, such as
[Humans](Human.md "wikilink"). However, they are much more enthusiastic
when it comes to battling matters or surviving bleak situations.

Shek's bodies are covered from head to toe in bony plates which serve as
an (Note that Sheks do not actually have any "natural armour". They will
take the same damage as any other race from attacks, only having better
HP) excellent natural armor. The Shek are also remarkable for their long
bony protrusion/horns, which are a source of pride for many Shek. They
are renowned for their exceptional strength and incredible toughness.
The Shek legend,
[Kral](Way_Of_The_Warrior:_The_Book_Of_Kral "wikilink"), is a testament
to the immense toughness of the Shek—or is at least indicative of how
much the Shek value toughness, strength, and courage.

Sheks are visually significantly larger than most other races, and thus
require more food than any other race to survive. It is important to
consider this before recruiting a Shek.

## History

The origins of the Shek is shrouded, but there are hints as to their
origin story. One theory is that the Shek were descendants of a class of
augmented Humans who were called the "Enforcers". This theory is
supported by the comments made by Black Desert City skeletons whenever
they meet a Shek within their walls. This can further explain why the
Holy Nation have such a hatred towards the Shek race, seeing as the
Enforcers aided the Skeletons of the Second Empire in cracking down on
the progenitor cult of the Holy Nation.

By the time of the fall of the Second Empire, the Shek were said to have
lived in countless warring tribes until a great warrior by the name of
Kral united the tribes and founded the Shek Kingdom. According to a book
called "Kral's Last Stand", the mighty Shek warlord was ambushed by a
great many enemies and was cut down. His warrior philosophy and the
story of his demise became a core principle within Shek society, where
it is expected for all Shek to die in glorious battle and to not do so
would bring great shame upon the individual.

## Trivia

- The [Holy Nation](Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") has a racial distrust for
  the Shek due to their religious beliefs and will attack Sheks that are
  approaching their cities without a human posing as "their master".
  They may also attack and "punish" sheks if getting too close to their
  patrolling squads outside of cities.
- They swim slower than any of the humanoid races.
- Their heal rate is 0.8, however due to the fact that all of their
  natural body parts have 125 HP, 0.8 x 1.25 = 1 which makes them heal
  the same amount of HP in a given time when compared to a Greenlander.
  However their lower heal rate results in robotic limbs taking 20%
  longer to heal when compared to a Greenlander. This also impacts the
  speed at which they recover their blood. Although they have an
  impressive racial bleed rate of 0.9x, on average they will take longer
  to recover their blood back to full when compared to even a
  Greenlander.
- When Sheks are [enslaved](Slavery.md "wikilink"), unlike humans (i.e
  Greenlanders and Scorchlanders) where they will have their hair shaved
  off, Sheks will have their horns cut off which results into a stubby
  horn look.
- Female Sheks breast cloths appear to be darker compared to that of
  Humans.
- As Dexterity experience uses [](Stronger_Opponent_Logic.md) based off your attack and
  the opponents defense/martial arts (If unarmed), Sheks bonus to attack
  and reduction to Dexterity gains results in a much lower Dexterity
  level than other races when training.

**Starving Vagrants** are members of the [Vagrants](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Vagrants.md "wikilink")
faction, and can be found around [Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink") and [](The_Great_Desert.md). They are similar to the
[Starving Bandits](Starving_Bandits.md "wikilink") in that they have
resorted to banditry in order to feed themselves.

They operate around the northwestern territory of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), most likely making them impoverished
outcasts from imperial society, similar to the [](Rebel_Farmers.md). They stop spawning after
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") has been killed or kidnapped.

The Vagrants have slightly better armor and weapons than [](Hungry_Bandit.md) gangs, and are slightly more dangerous
as they can wield sharper weapons.

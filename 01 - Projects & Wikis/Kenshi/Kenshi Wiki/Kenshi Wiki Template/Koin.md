**Koin** is a high-ranking member of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) found in [Heft](Heft.md "wikilink"), and
has [Diplomatic Status](Diplomatic_Status.md "wikilink"). He appears and
acts like the secretary and spokesperson for [](Emperor_Tengu.md). He can be spoken to for an alliance
with the United Cities. This takes the form of buying one's way in via
high sums of cats, establishing a large outpost in United Cities
territory for trade, or waging war against the Anti-Slavers. The latter
of which will require subduing and turning in Tinfist.

**Mountain Dogs** are larger variants of their cousins the
[Bonedogs](Bonedog.md "wikilink"). It is unclear where these creatures are
native to, as none of them nor their nests spawn in the wild. However
they frequently accompany [](Cannibal_Hunters.md), who put their strength to use
wiping out the painted tribes.

Given the name and location, it is perhaps implied they are native to
the mountains north of [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"),
though this is purely speculation.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Mountain Dogs can have one of three qualities for their "weapon".
(Moving their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change
to another quality of the weapon) The 18 in the cut calculation is from
the minimum cut damage (13) combined with 5 piercing damage which
Bonedogs have.

**Variant 1**

**Cut =** 18 + 0.77961008 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**Variant 2**

**Cut =** 18 + 0.83928 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**Variant 3**

**Cut =** 18 + 0.89894992 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt** **=** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

- The Guy with a Dog start used to begin with a Mountain Dog pup instead
  of the much smaller [Bonedog](Bonedog.md "wikilink") pup.

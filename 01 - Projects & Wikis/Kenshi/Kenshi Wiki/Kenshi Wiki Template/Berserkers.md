**Berserkers** are rogue Shek fighters that believe the shek should
return back to their old tribal nature. Combat levels are in the 40+.

While talking to [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink") about alliances, the player
can suggest 'taking care of their berserker problem.' Bayan responds to
that choice by saying that the [Shek Kingdom](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink")
will take care of the berserkers by themselves.

The berserker Sheks are recognized by their
[maroon](Colour_Scheme.md "wikilink") clothes and armour.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

## Trivia

- Despite having no direct traversing route, and isolated, the
  Berserkers in the [Berserker Country](Berserker_Country.md "wikilink")
  are still somehow affected by the death of [Ghost](Ghost.md "wikilink")
  located in the Southern region.

[The Old Empire](The_Old_Empire.md "wikilink") are the remains of the
ancient civilization that once controlled the entire world. Their
written language is now unrecognizable to modern eyes. What is left of
their civilization are the scattered [](Lost_Library.md) and
[Armories](Lost_Armoury.md "wikilink") around the world, where the player
may find [Ancient Science books](Ancient_Science_Book.md "wikilink"), [](AI%20Core.md), [](Security_Spider.md) and
[Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink").

How this mighty empire was destroyed is unknown, but it is speculated
that it was their own weapon systems or possibly
[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") that destroyed them.

A successor empire simply known as the "[](Second_Empire.md)" sprang from the Old Empire's ashes,
notably being much smaller in scale and controlled by
[Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- While this page refers to the "Old Empire" exclusively as the "First
  Empire", There are several locations in Kenshi that have "**Old
  Empire**" in their name (i.e [](Old_Empire_Watchtower.md), [](Old_Empire_Supply_Outpost.md)) but have **Second
  Empire** as their faction label instead of [](The_Old_Empire.md) (which is a cut-content faction).
  They could be named eponymously so because both civilizations are
  considered to be "Old" by modern standards, be it the "First Empire"
  or the "Second Empire".

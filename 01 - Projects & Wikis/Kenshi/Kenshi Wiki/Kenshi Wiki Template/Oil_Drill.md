![](Oil_Drill.jpg "Oil_Drill.jpg") As of version 1.0.10 the [](Oil_Drill.md) is currently not implemented in the base
game (Except for one that appears in [Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink")). It
is however possible to access and build the [](Oil_Drill.md) by using the in-game editor (Shift + F12).
This building can be found under the 'Mining' section of buildings.

Despite the fact that there is already at least one [](Oil_Drill.md) placed in the game, they are currently only
a decoration. They do not produce [Fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink") or any other
item.

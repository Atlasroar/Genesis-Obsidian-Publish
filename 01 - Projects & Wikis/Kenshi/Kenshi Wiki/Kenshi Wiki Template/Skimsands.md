**Skimsands** acts like a buffer zone between the United Cities and the
Holy Nation as both sides patrol the area, the relative calmness of this
area stands in stark contrast to the heated war zone in
[Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink"). As its name suggests, is also the home
to packs of [Skimmers](Skimmer.md "wikilink"), making it harder for players
to traverse the area. It's also the location of a prison, [](Tengu's_Vault.md), which houses a group of [](Unique_Recruits.md).

## Tips

- Due to high numbers of Skimmers roaming the area, players need to
  exercise caution when traversing the Skimsands, especially the weaker
  player characters. Skimmers tend to move and attack in packs, and is
  not uncommon travelers to be attacked by more than one group of
  Skimmers.
- The Skimsands has none, if very little natural resources for players
  to exploit and is thus unsuitable for constructing a self-sustaining
  outpost. The constant presence of Skimmer packs in the area makes the
  Skimsands even more dangerous for would-be settlers.

## Trivia

- **Skimsands** contains a lot of Behemoth bodies.
- Despite having nests assigned to this area, the nest spawn limit is
  set to "0" (no nests will spawn). Presumably because the homeless
  Skimmers spawns are already prevalent enough.

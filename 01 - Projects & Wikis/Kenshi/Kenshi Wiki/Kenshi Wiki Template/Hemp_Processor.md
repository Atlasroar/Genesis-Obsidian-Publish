The **Hemp Processor** turns [Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink") into
[Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink"). It can be constructed after researching
[Hashish Production](Hashish_Production_(Tech).md "wikilink"). It has a
power consumption of 20 and it requires five bundles of hemp and one
barrel of [Water](Water.md "wikilink") to produce one unit of hashish.
Using the Hemp Processor trains the [Science](Science.md "wikilink") stat,
and higher levels might result in faster production times.

Many Hemp Processors can be found in the [](Secret_Drug_Farm.md).

**Police Station Towers**are buildings found in most major faction
cities. Find them by looking for signs posted near the door, or by
clicking on the building and checking the name.

In Police Stations, players are able to turn in
[bounties](Bounty.md "wikilink") by imprisoning the bounty yourself in one
of the [cages](Prisoner_Cage.md "wikilink"), talking to the [](Police_Chief.md), [](Hundred_Guardian.md), or
[Inquisitor](Inquisitor.md "wikilink") usually standing behind a table. If
you talk and give bounties to the chief, they will take them to the
second floor and place them in one of the many cells, with the
prisoner's weapon stored in one of the nearby containers. They will be
available to buy from the Chief with a huge 75% discount (better to take
their equipment and sell it separately before you turn them in).
However, dead bounties will only net you half the reward.

Dead or alive, most bounties will raise the relation with the
[faction](Factions.md "wikilink") by 2 points, but be warned, this might
happen only if you take them to the Chief directly, not imprison the
bounty yourself.

If the cells are full, you can still turn in bounties to the Chief.
They'll take them from you if they aren't carrying someone else, but
you'll still receive the bounty and increased relations even if their
hands are occupied. Typically, if all the cells are full, the Chiefs
would normally throw the body outside. This can be exploited, allowing a
player to repeatedly turn in the body for a bounty.

There are [training dummies](Training_Dummy.md "wikilink") here that can be
used. The residents (unless allied) will however not approve and berate
the player for doing so.

Known simply as "***Game Starts***", players begin the game by selecting
one of the 13 Beginnings which change how the player starts their game.
Each start can drastically change the equipment, skills, currency, and
amount of party members that the player starts out with making the game
easier or harder depending on the player's chosen start. If the default
choices are no longer interesting, it is always possible to [](Creating_a_New_Game_Start.md) through modding.

Full details on the characters, including both their stats and their
equipment can be found on their page, accessed by clicking their name.
Malnourished: True means that all characters in the squad will start
with 170/300 hunger. Limitations are if there are only certain races
which can do a start. Starts marked with an asterisk (\*) limit the
player's choice for a starting [race](Races.md "wikilink").

- **Limitations:** None
- **Advice:** If playing with default settings you can find
  [Riddly](Riddly.md "wikilink") inside one of the two bars in Heng as a
  free recruit. For a nice ~c.40,000 to c.50,000 early, due to a weird
  interaction provided your non-animal characters are on passive and not
  set to defend your allies you can attack
  [Harmothoe](Harmothoe.md "wikilink") at the start with the bull you
  control and run to the Traders Guild guards nearby for assistance. You
  can then pick up your Bull, loot Harmothoe and swap back to the bull
  to take her stuff to avoid getting a bounty. Do the same with her
  Garru along with the items they hold.

### **<u>The Holy Sword</u>**

- **Location:** [The Hub](The_Hub.md "wikilink")
- **Money:** c.100
- **Relations:** (-100) with both [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and [](Imperial_Lords.md). (Imperial Lords are not actually

  and 3) quality [Nodachi](Nodachi.md "wikilink"), [](Black_Cloth_Shirt.md), [](Ninja_Pants.md) and \[Shoddy\] (5% Chance of
  \[Standard\]) [Ninja Rags](Ninja_Rags.md "wikilink"). In their inventory
  is a single [](Standard_First_Aid_Kit.md).
- **Malnourished:** False
- ***Playstyl*e:** Wanted Criminal (Difficulty: Harder)
- **Limitations:** None
- **Advice:** Only your starting character has a bounty and due to the
  fact that the Imperial Lords are not used in game you can still enter
  United City towns without the fear of being attacked for your bounty
  by the guards.

### **<u>The Cannibal Hunters</u>**

- **Location:** [Cannibal Village](Cannibal_Village.md "wikilink")
- **Money:** c.9
- **Relations:** Default

- **Malnourished:** False
- **Playstyle:** Action RPG (Difficulty: Dodgy)
- **Limitations:** None
- **Advice:** As you start in a Cannibal Village you'll need to escape

  armour which reduces your athletics or is encumbering you and
  sprinting to the nearest pool of water is your best chance at
  survival.

- **Money:** c.0
- **Relations:** Default
- **Bounty:** None
- **Squad Info:** A single character with 1 in all stats.

- **Advice:** As a Hiveless (A Hiver who was exiled from their hive) you
  are unable to buy or sell from the traders in the villages. The best
  chance at survival for newer players is to leave Vain as soon as
  possible so you can get your hands on some first aid kits so you do
  not die from a random injury you receive. Or you could try your luck
  at looting some eggs from a Beak Thing nest at night and hope that you
  encounter a Hive Caravan which will trade with you even if you are
  Hiveless.

### **<u>Son of a Captain</u>**

- **Location:** [The Hub](The_Hub.md "wikilink")
- **Money:** c.0
- **Relations:** (-100) relations with [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), and (100) relations with the
  [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink")
- **Bounty:** None
- **Squad Info:** A single character with 1 in all stats. Equipped with
  a \[Shoddy\] (5% chance of \[Standard\]) [](Leather_Shirt.md), some [](Samurai_Clothpants.md), a pair of [](Drifter's_Boots.md), a (Equal chance of Catun 1, 2
  and 3) [Catun](Catun_Scrapmaster_(Manufacturer).md "wikilink") quality
  [Katana](Katana.md "wikilink"), some [Gohan](Gohan.md "wikilink"), and a
  [Standard first aid kit](Standard_First_Aid_Kit.md "wikilink").
- **Malnourished:** False
- **Playstyle:** RPG (Difficulty: Normal)
- **Limitations:** None
- **Advice:** The Standard first aid kit has a random quality when you
  create the character. If it has a very small amount of charges you can
  sell it to a shop, close the shop, and then reopen it to buy it back
  at full charges. (Of course, you'll need some money to afford the
  charges they refilled for you)

### **<u>The Slaves\*</u>**

- **Location:** [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink")
- **Money:** c.0
- **Relations:** Default
- **Bounty:** None

- **Playstyle:** RPG (Difficulty: Hard)
- **Limitations:** You cannot start as a Skeleton with this start.
- **Advice:** Allow your characters to work until night. Once put into
  your cage (Or pole) sneak into a building if you wish to get a bite to
  eat and then sneak your way out of Rebirth by heading east. If you
  want to use some other slaves as distractions to help you get away in
  case you are noticed then free the ones on the poles outside as they
  are less likely to be watched by guards. Avoid the south and west
  exits as they can be guarded by units on Mounted Crossbows. After you
  escape you can get a lot of food by making your way to the [](Flotsam_Safehouse.md) (Marked as Lone Shack from
  far away) by looping around mountain range or swimming through Wend.

### **<u>Rock Bottom</u>**

<figure>
<img src="Rock_Bottom_Start_Map.png"

<figcaption>Rock_Bottom_Start_Map.png</figcaption>
</figure>

- **Location:** [The Great Desert](The_Great_Desert.md "wikilink") east of
  [Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink")
- **Money:** c.0
- **Relations:** Default
- **Bounty:** None
- **Squad Info:** A single 1 in all stats character missing their left
  arm.
- **Malnourished:** True
- **Playstyle:** RPG (Difficulty: Very Hard)
- **Limitations:** None
- **Advice:** As it is against the law to be starving in United Cities
  territory, attempting to enter a town may cause a Gate Sargeant to
  initiate dialogue with you and then (depending on their personality)
  attack you. To avoid this, you can head east to the Old Village and
  find a nice amount of loot to sell. Once looted you can either wander
  around the desert and trail behind wild Garru, Skimmers or Rebel
  Farmers (Bonedog) until they are knocked out to get meat to cook on a
  campfire, hope to find a Hive Caravan patrolling around or go north
  west to the [Distant Hive Villages](Distant_Hive_Village.md "wikilink")
  to sell your loot and purchase food.

### **<u>Empire Citizen</u>**

- **Location:** Sho-Battai
- **Money:** c.750
- **Relations:** Default
- **Bounty:** None
- **Squad Info:** A single character with 1 in all stats. They come
  equipped with a [Rag Shirt](Rag_Shirt.md "wikilink"), [](Halfpants_(ragged).md) and [](Wooden_Sandals.md).
- **Malnourished:** False
- **Playstyle:** RPG (Difficulty: Default)
- **Limitations:** None
- **Advice:** The [](United_Heroes_League.md) group which spawns in the
  town can be attacked right away and the guards will assist you as they
  are classified as bandits. This can get you a nice head start on cats
  to help you afford a Crossbow, a backpack, bandages or whatever else
  you might want. If you find a Sand Ninja Jonin patrolling near the
  town and lure them to the guards they have a c.6,000 to c.10,000
  bounty along with 2x Catun Scrapmaster grade Guardless Katanas
  totaling an extra c.4,722 to c.7,194 from their weapons along. A
  single Jonin will allow you to afford a small shack in town, the
  research materials to learn how to craft Bandanas and the materials to
  get to a profitable level of Armoursmithing. (20+ from Bandanas)

### **<u>Holy Nation Citizen\*</u>**

- **Location:** [Bad Teeth](Bad_Teeth.md "wikilink") or
  [Stack](Stack.md "wikilink")
- **Money:** c.200
- **Relations:** (15) [The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")
- **Bounty:** None
- **Squad Info:** A single 1 all stats character. Equipped with an
  Unknown quality Iron Club, wearing a \[Shoddy\] (5% chance of
  \[Standard\]) Stout Hessian, Cloth Shirt and \[Shoddy\] (5% chance of
  \[Standard\]) Drifter's Boots. In your inventory will be a single [](The_Holy_Flame.md).
- **Malnourished:** False
- **Playstyle:** RPG (Difficulty: Default)
- **Limitations:** Only able to create a [Human](Human.md "wikilink")
  character.
- **Advice:** If you create a female character and are questioned by a
  Priest resist the urge to insult him or it will lead to an arrest
  followed by [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink"). Do NOT attempt to bribe any
  guards or mention Narko to them. Suggested to sell your low quality
  armour to the boot store if you start in Stack and purchase some
  Wooden Sandals so you can outrun any hostiles in the area.

### **<u>Guy with a Dog</u>**

- **Location:** [Bast](Bast.md "wikilink")
- **Money:** c.13
- **Relations:** Default
- **Bounty:** None
- **Squad Info:** Two characters. One is a humanoid who has 1 in all
  stats, a [Basic First Aid Kit](Basic_First_Aid_Kit.md "wikilink"),
  wearing a [Rag Loincloth](Rag_Loincloth.md "wikilink") and wielding an
  [Unknown](Unknown.md "wikilink") quality [](Iron_Stick.md). The other character is a baby Bonedog
  who has 20 (randomized by 5) in their combat
  [Stats](Statistics.md "wikilink"), however due to the penalties from
  being a baby its [Stats](Statistics.md "wikilink") will seem as if they
  are zero. Over time the dog will age and the penalty will lessen, and
  eventually become a bonus.
- **Malnourished:** True
- **Playstyle:** RPG (Difficulty: Normal)
- **Limitations:** None
- **Advice:** Picking up your Bonedog may be a good idea early as they
  are incredibly slow early on. There are plenty of Bonedog nests nearby
  which are usually attacked by the Holy Nation and United City troops.
  If food is still difficult to come by you can enter
  [Drin](Drin.md "wikilink") from the sides (Avoid the gate) and sell off
  items to the bar to purchase some cheap Dried Meat. The beds in the
  bar are also free to use. Funnily enough putting your Bonedog and
  starting character in the cages in Bast will actually fill up their
  hunger until it reaches 200. Just beware of cannibal patrols which can
  spawn in the area!

### **<u>The Freedom Seekers</u>**

- **Location:** Random [Waystation](Waystation.md "wikilink")
- **Money:** c.4,000
- **Relations:** Default
- **Bounty:** Old Soldier - c.20,000 Wanted by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md)

  [Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink"), 17 [Gohan](Gohan.md "wikilink"), 9
  [Basic First Aid Kits](Basic_First_Aid_Kit.md "wikilink"), a single
  [Standard First Aid Kit](Standard_First_Aid_Kit.md "wikilink"), a
  blueprint for [](Wheatstraw_Farming_(Tech).md). Five of the members
  have a 1 in all [Stats](Statistics.md "wikilink"), along with [](Halfpants_(ragged).md) and
  [Unknown](Unknown_(manufacturer).md "wikilink") quality
  [Wakizashis](Wakizashi.md "wikilink"). The remaining character among them
  is an "Old Soldier" who has around 20-25 average stats. For a more in
  depth list of the unit's stats check Trivia below. The Old Solider is
  armed with an [Ancient](Ancient_(Manufacturer).md "wikilink") quality
  [Horse Chopper](Horse_Chopper.md "wikilink") and is wearing \[Shoddy\]
  (5% chance of \[Standard\]) [Leather Shirt](Leather_Shirt.md "wikilink"),
  [Samurai Clothpants](Samurai_Clothpants.md "wikilink") and [](Drifter's_Boots.md). On top of that [](Storm_House.md), [Storage:
  Wheatstraw](Storage:_Wheatstraw "wikilink") come already researched.
- **Malnourished:** False
- **Playstyle:** Real-Time Strategy (Difficulty: Easy / Hard
  Combination)
- **Limitations:** None

### **<u>Nobodies</u>**

- **Location:** [The Hub](The_Hub.md "wikilink") or one the two [](Waystation_Ruins.md)
- **Money:** c.0
- **Relations:** Default
- **Bounty:** None
- **Squad Info:** 5 characters with 1 in all stats. Each of them are
  armed with an Unknown quality [Iron Stick](Iron_Stick.md "wikilink") and
  are wearing [Cargopants](Cargopants.md "wikilink"). They also have 2
  [Basic First Aid Kit](Basic_First_Aid_Kit.md "wikilink") in their
  inventory.
- **Malnourished:** True
- **Playstyle:** RPG (Difficulty: Easy)
- **Limitations:** None
- **Advice:** If you start in the Waystation Ruins in Venge quickly loot
  the two [Skeleton Repair Kits](Skeleton_Repair_Kit.md "wikilink") found
  there and either rush west to [](Smugglers_Bar.md) to sell them for food or (A bit more
  risky) north east to the Grey Desert
  [Waystation](Waystation_(Grey_Desert).md "wikilink"). If you are placed
  at the Waystation Ruins in Stobe's Garden do the same as with the
  other ruins but this time go straight north (Avoid the west (Unwanted
  Zone) as it is populated with Beak Thing nests) until you see a water
  pool. Once you reach the water head north west to arrive at Black
  Scratch.

## Cut starts

These starts were likely cut or either removed from the game. They are
found in the [FCS](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md "wikilink").

### **Hungover Ninja**

- Starts with only 1 character in the stone camp southwest of
  [Sho-Battai](Sho-Battai.md "wikilink") with no [Cats](Cats.md "wikilink").
  The character has 5 in basic combat [Stats](Statistics.md "wikilink"), 10
  Assassin and Thievery, and 20 stealth. Wearing a [](Ninja_Gi.md), [](Martial_Artist_Bindings.md), and a [](Basket_Hat.md), and wielding an
  [Ancient](Ancient.md "wikilink") quality [](Ninja_Blade.md).
- (*Playstyle: RPG*) (*Difficulty: Hard*)

## Trivia

- The Guy With a Dog start seems to be a reference to the Fallout series
  (The player starts with 13 cats, referencing Vault 13 and the player
  could also obtain a pet called Dogmeat in Fallout games 1, 2, 3 and
  4). It could also be a reference to "A boy and his dog" a 1975
  post-apocalyptic indie movie, or "Mad Max 2" (aka *The Road Warrior*)
  from 1981. Since "A boy and his dog" together with "Mad Max 2"
  inspired the creation of Fallout's Dogmeat the reference is hard to
  trace.

<!-- -->

- The Guy With a Dog used to start with a baby Mountain Dog, but this
  was later changed to a less powerful Bonedog.

<!-- -->

- The Beginning "*Son of a Captain*" used to be called "*The Retired
  Captain*".
- The stats which the Retired Soldier has in the Freedom Seekers start
  are, 25 Strength/Toughness/Attack/Defense/Athletics, 20
  Dexerity/Labouring/Blunt/Hackers/Heavy Weapons/Sabres, 15 Turrets, and
  10 Unarmed/Medic/Katana.

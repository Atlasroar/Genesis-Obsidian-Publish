**Yayoi** is a member of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md).

She is intended to be the leader of an Ally Reinforcements
[Event](Events.md "wikilink"), arriving at the player's Outpost with 4-10
[Flotsam Ninja](Flotsam_Ninja.md "wikilink") characters to protect the
player from base assaults by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), including [](Wrath_of_God.md). However, there have been reports that she
does not spawn in.

Her event is set to not trigger if [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") is [](World_States.md) or if the player is allied with the
[Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink").

She has a 30,000 Cats Bounty from [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). She has a Brave
[Personality](Personality.md "wikilink") and no unique dialogue aside from
announcement dialogue when she arrives at the player's Outpost.

## Trivia

- The issue regarding Yayoi not spawning appears to be due to a missing
  squad template. The mod, [Yayoi
  Appears](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2841885683),
  should fix this issue if you experience it.
- This character shares the same name as someone listed in the
  [Credits](Credits.md "wikilink") under Additional Translators.

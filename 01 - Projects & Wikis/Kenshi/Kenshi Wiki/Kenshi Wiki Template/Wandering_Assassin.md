**Wandering Assassins** are [](Shinobi_Thieves.md) who wander the world of Kenshi.
They will heal player characters and help in a battle if the player is
allied with the Shinobi Thieves.

Though their primary job is "Wandering Trader", players cannot trade
with them. In daylight hours, they will stop to trade with local
merchants.

Wandering Assassins always spawn in a squad alone. They have a chance of
spawning in the following zones: [Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink"),
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"), [Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink"),
[Spider Plains](Spider_Plains.md "wikilink"), [](The_Great_Desert.md), [The Hook](The_Hook.md "wikilink"),
[The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink").

Combat is a primary part of Kenshi, and all combat except for martial
arts is done with weapons. Weapons are [Items](Items.md "wikilink") that
are split into multiple categories, each dealing different types and
amounts of damage. [Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") is designed to reduce
damage and can be slightly penetrated by using certain weapons. Weapons
can be looted, purchased from a [](Weapons_Trader.md), or crafted by the player.

## Equipping Weapons

Characters in Kenshi have two weapon slots; Weapon I (primary slot) and
Weapon II (secondary slot). All weapons can be equipped in the primary
slot, however weapons may only be equipped in the secondary slot if they
possess no larger than an Inventory Height of 1 and an Inventory Width
of 7. Characters will typically use what is equipped in Weapon I over
Weapon II unless penalties are applied, such as the left arm being
unusable or using certain weapons indoors. If the right arm is unusable,
the character will not use equipped weapons. Multiple weapons may be
equipped within Weapon I, but the character will only use the topmost
weapon in that slot in combat. The bonus stats (and debuffs) will only
apply for the weapon currently being used.

## Melee Weapons

These are weapons which make use and train a character's [](Melee_Attack.md) and [](Melee_Defense.md) stats, as well as the specific melee
weapon skill associated with the weapon type.

## Ranged Weapons

These are weapons which make use and train a character's [](Precision_Shooting.md) and
[Perception](Perception.md "wikilink") stats, as well as the specific
ranged weapon skill associated with the weapon type.

### Crossbows

> [Crossbows](Crossbows.md "wikilink") are ranged weapons which are
> equipped in a character's primary weapon slot. These weapons require
> ammunition. Crossbow grades are more similar to
> [Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") grades than to Melee Weapon grades.

### Turrets

> [Turrets](Turrets.md "wikilink") are defensive buildings which have
> unlimited ammunition.

**Water Jug** is a useless [Junk](Junk.md "wikilink") Item: no purpose
other than trading and only worth a small amount. This item can be found
in Residential Buildings. When starting out, stealing this item along
with other junk can help players increase
their [Thievery](Thievery.md "wikilink") stat with little risk (if the
building is empty) and reward.

Despite being full of [Water](Water.md "wikilink"), the Water Jug is not
functional in the same way which barrels of water are. Water Jugs cannot
be used in a farm or a cooking stove. They are also not a viable
[Food](Food.md "wikilink") item.

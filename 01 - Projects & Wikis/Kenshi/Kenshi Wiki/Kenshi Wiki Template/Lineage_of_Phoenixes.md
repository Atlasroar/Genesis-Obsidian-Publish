This Page details the various notable events related to the Phoenixes of
different generations.

### Phoenix the First

- Founder of [The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink").
- Author of [](Scripture_of_Radiance_Series.md).
- Claimed that his soul will be reincarnated into the next first born
  male, therefore creating the lineage of Phoenixes.
- Declared Phoenix to be the champion sent by Okran, "one that would
  restore our faith and banish the Shadow" in his own words.

### Holy Lord Phoenix IV

- Author of [Birth Of The Phoenix](Birth_Of_The_Phoenix.md "wikilink"),
  declared Phoenix's soul as an extension of [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink")
  and therefore divinely pure and incorruptible, as well as proclaiming
  that only the Phoenix can be the one to guide their faith.

### Holy Lord Phoenix XLVII

- Alleged manufacturer of [Chalice Of Fire](Chalice_Of_Fire.md "wikilink").

### Holy Lord Phoenix LXII

- The [current Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink") where the
  [players](Nameless.md "wikilink") story takes place.
- Sentenced his own family to be executed at the age of 16.
- Author of [Holy Edict](Holy_Edict.md "wikilink") and [](The_Holy_Crusade.md).
- Said to be one of the harshest in the line of Phoenixes.
- Likely to be the leader that successfully managed to soundly defeat
  the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") and declare war on [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md).
- Smells of vegetables.

## Trivia

- The average lifespan (or the time until next reincarnation, if you
  will) of a Phoenix is around 80.6 years. This takes into account that
  the Holy Nation has a history of around 5000 years divided by 62. This
  is way above the average lifespan for people living in a
  post-apocalypse world. There is a possibility that the reason of why
  Phoenixes can manage to live that long is because of the HN's advanced
  medicinal technology (in contrast to the otherwise low-tech nature of
  nearly all other aspects of their country). The evidence that supports
  the theory that HN has advanced medicinal technology is given that HN
  has [doctors](Doctor.md "wikilink") and [surgeons](Surgeon.md "wikilink") in
  their country while other countries don't and also that Lord Phoenix
  LXII's inventory includes [](Advanced_First_Aid_Kit.md) and [](Advanced_Splint_Kit.md).

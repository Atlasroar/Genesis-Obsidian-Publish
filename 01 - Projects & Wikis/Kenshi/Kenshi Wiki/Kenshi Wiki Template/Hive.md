![](Hive.png "Hive.png")The **Hive**, also known as Hivers, are a
[Race](Races.md "wikilink") of stick-like humanoids who are meant to
collaborate under a collective mind, ruled by a [](Hive_Queen.md) and her princes. Hive characters are
separated into many subspecies with their own unique appearance. The
majority of the Hivers care for little else other than the Hive's
happiness and survival and are willing to give their lives for the Hive
as a whole.

The longer a Hiver is separated from their Hive, the more their bond
with it will weaken, giving way to an increased sense of will and a lack
of purpose, although some of them will instead die. Once the bond breaks
completely, Hiver characters cannot return and are considered "Hiveless"
or "Lost Ones", as they are no longer connected to their Queen's
pheromones. The Hiveless have complete free will and individuality,
although they will feel purposeless and depressed, now that they have
independence. Princes that are still connected to their Hive will become
distressed at the presence of a Hiveless in their vicinity, and if
possible, alert any nearby Hive Drone if the Lost One refuses to leave.

There are two hive minds: [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") and
[Southern Hive](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink"). Both of these hives are led
by a Hive Queen.

## [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink")

The Western Hive is the friendliest Hive [Faction](Factions.md "wikilink").
Western Hive can be found in many zones of Kenshi, often in Trade
Caravans. This faction is home to hivers who are of these races:

- [Hive Prince](Hive_Prince.md "wikilink")
- [Hive Soldier Drone](Hive_Soldier_Drone.md "wikilink")
- [Hive Worker Drone](Hive_Worker_Drone.md "wikilink")
- [Hive Queen](Hive_Queen.md "wikilink")

## [Southern Hive](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink")

The Southern Hive is a violent faction. They can originally only be
found in the southeastern quarter of Kenshi, but depending on [](World_States.md) created by the player, they can invade
new areas. This faction is home to hivers who are of these races:

- [Southern Hive Prince](Southern_Hive_Prince.md "wikilink")
- [Southern Hive Soldier Drone](Southern_Hive_Soldier_Drone.md "wikilink")
- [Southern Hive Worker Drone](Southern_Hive_Worker_Drone.md "wikilink")
- (Southern) [Hive Queen](Hive_Queen.md "wikilink")

## [Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink")

When hivers are separated from their hive, they can become corrupted and
turned into Fogmen. Fogmen are insane, cannibalistic, and numerous.
Players should be careful when Fogmen are nearby. This faction is home
to hivers who are of these races:

- [Deadhive Prince](Deadhive_Prince.md "wikilink")
- [Deadhive Soldier](Deadhive_Soldier.md "wikilink")
- [Deadhive Worker](Deadhive_Worker.md "wikilink")

## Play Style

Hivers are healed through the [Field Medic](Field_Medic.md "wikilink") stat
with [First Aid Kits](Medical_Items.md "wikilink") like
[Humans](Human.md "wikilink") are. This healing can be sped up through the
use of [Beds](Bed.md "wikilink") and [Camp Beds](Camp_Bed.md "wikilink").
Hivers typically have lower limb health than characters of other races,
meaning that loss of limbs is highly likely. On top of that, when you
lose a limb, around 6 to 30 blood (The amount is random and not
influenced by stats) is lost instantly along with a large amount of
bleeding. It is important to take care as losing a limb could results in
death due to blood loss if you do not have a replacement on hand. Lost
limbs will need to be replaced with [](Robot_Limbs.md), which are healed with [](Skeleton_Repair_Kit.md) like
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") characters.

All Hive characters gain experience at a higher rate for
[Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink"). The subraces have experience
multipliers for other stats as well, meaning that some combat styles
will train faster than others.

Players should ensure their Hiver characters have adequate armour
protection, primarily because of their low health bars compared to other
races. [Soldier Drones](Hive_Soldier_Drone.md "wikilink") cannot wear any
equipment in the "[HEAD](Headgear.md "wikilink")" slot, and the other
subraces have specific limitations on that slot as well. All Hive
subraces are restricted regarding the "[SHIRT](Shirts.md "wikilink")" slot
since they are unable to wear regular shirts. Hiver shirts are inferior
to normal ones as they lack arm protection. Hive characters are also
unable to wear equipment in the "[BOOTS](Footwear.md "wikilink")" slot
since they have no feet; this has resulted in [](Hive_Prisoner_Shackles.md) existing to be equipped in
the "[ARMOR"](Body_Armour.md "wikilink") slot.

Most Hivers are capable of consuming [Raw Meat](Raw_Meat.md "wikilink") and
[Foul Raw Meat](Foul_Raw_Meat.md "wikilink"), [](Hive_Prince.md) being the exception as they cannot eat
the [Foul Raw Meat](Foul_Raw_Meat.md "wikilink"). This means that they can
easily find food as long as there is [Fauna](Fauna.md "wikilink") nearby.
Hivers are immune to Acid, meaning they do not need to worry about [](Acid_Ground.md), acidic bodies of water, and [](Weather_Effects.md#Acid_Rain). They are still harmed or
hindered by other [Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink"), and
players should be aware that there is no way to protect [](Hive_Soldier_Drone.md) from Gas entirely.

Hive merchants in Hive Villages dislike Hiveless characters and will
refuse to sell them goods. Players should use a character of another
race to trade with these merchants. This does not apply for [](Hive_Caravan_Boss.md), which wander many regions, as
they might even follow and harass Hiver player characters in order to
trade.

Due to religious reasons, [The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink")
views Hivers as an impure race. Holy Nation military will harass and
attack hivers that approach their cities alone. Any captured hivers will
be sent to [Holy Mines](Holy_Mines.md "wikilink") or the infamous
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") until their death.

[Princes](Hive_Prince.md "wikilink") gain experience at a higher rate for
[Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink"), [Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink"),
and [Thievery](Thievery.md "wikilink"). This fact likely contributed to the
racist attitudes which characters from the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) have towards hivers, evidenced by the
[United Weekly Series](United_Weekly_Series.md "wikilink").

Hivers all have a 60 chance to be hit in their stomach, and 140 for
their chest which results in most KOs coming from chest injuries.

## Lore

The sixth volume in [](The_Guiding_Light_Series.md) refers to Hivers. This book
shows how hivers are viewed by Okranites, who refer to them as "insect
fiends."

The first and fifth volume in [](United_Weekly_Series.md) refers to Hivers. The first one
is an empire perspective on an increase of Hiver citizens in the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md). The fifth volume is a story of empire
traders visiting [Hive Villages](Distant_Hive_Village.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- Hivers are born from the [Queen's](Hive_Queen.md "wikilink") dispenser
  unit.
- Only Western Soldier and Worker drones can eat [](Human_Teeth.md).
- Hivers apparently love fish. [Deadcat](Deadcat.md "wikilink") fish
  sellers will especially try to get the attention of Hivers.
- Normally, hivers do not have a concept of individual names, but the
  Hiveless do, and usually give themselves a name, like
  [Beep](Beep.md "wikilink") and [Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink").
  - A contradictory twitter post says "Hivers choose their names based
    on the first thing they see."[^1]
- Hivers have no anatomical sex and in character creation have their
  gender setting locked to " - ", but are generally referred to as male
  by members of other races. This has no mechanical effect in practice,
  as the [only faction](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") that behaves
  differently based on characters' gender is also automatically hostile
  to Hivers. [Beep](Beep.md "wikilink") has dialogue suggesting that he at
  least does not consider himself female, but also that he has minimal
  understanding of what "female" is.
- Dialogue in game suggests that the huts in the hive villages are at
  least partially made of Hiver vomit.
- Dialogue from Hivers of Western Hive when being healed implicate that
  when a Hiver is missing a limb or severely injured the community will
  just dispose of the Hiver into the crematory.
- Hivers seem to enjoy acid rain.
- Hivers screams seem to almost always include "G", such as "GAHH!" or
  "Greee!"
- **Southern Hive** characters are not properly implemented for play and
  are frequently treated as being human.
- Hivers in general, though especially the [](Hive_Worker_Drone.md), act exceptionally childish
  compared to other races.
- "No-Hive" is a term given by non-defected Hivers that can be applied
  to every race, including the defected Hivers themselves, but
  "Hiveless" refers more commonly to the Hivers that have defected from
  the Hive.
- [Beep](Beep.md "wikilink") is a Hiver!

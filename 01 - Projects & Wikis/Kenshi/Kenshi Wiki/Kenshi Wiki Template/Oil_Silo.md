As of version 1.0.0 the [Oil Silo](Oil_Silo.md "wikilink") is currently not
implemented in the base game. It is however possible to access and build
the [Oil Silo](Oil_Silo.md "wikilink") by using the in-game editor (Shift +
F12). This building can be found under the 'Mining' section in the build
menu.

Although certain building types like the Generator require fuel, the
[Oil Silo](Oil_Silo.md "wikilink") is not used in the process.

**Red** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink"). She can be
found in [Bark](Bark.md "wikilink"), wandering around the city. She has a
Brave personality.

If the player has more than 200 cats, and is in a squad smaller than 5,
Red has a chance to pickpocket them when in talking range. The player
can immediately talk to Red to demand their money back. Choosing
non-aggressive dialogue will eventually lead to asking Red to join the
player.

Red will not join if the player has more than 100,000 Cats and more than
one backpack, instead running away.

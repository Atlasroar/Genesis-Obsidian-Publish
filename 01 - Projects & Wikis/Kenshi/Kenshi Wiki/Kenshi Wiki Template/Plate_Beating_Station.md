The **Plate Beating Station** is a crafting building type introduced in
patch 0.50. This crafting station allows players to craft [](Armour_Plating.md) from [](Raw_Iron.md). Armour Plating is later used to construct
plate based armour at the [](Heavy_Armour_Smithy.md). The station requires no power
to run, but does require manual labour of a worker. Using it improves
the [Armour Smithing](Armour_Smith.md "wikilink") skill.

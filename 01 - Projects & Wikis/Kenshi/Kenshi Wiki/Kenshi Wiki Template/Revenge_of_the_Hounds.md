**Revenge of the Hounds** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") can trigger
as a result of killing or capturing [Big Grim](Big_Grim.md "wikilink"), or
by defeating the [Hound Check In](Hound_Check_In.md "wikilink") event. It
has a 100% chance of triggering each day if the
[Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 1,000 meters of
[Rot](Rot.md "wikilink"), this chance scales down with distance until it
reaches 0% at 6,000 meters.

Once the conditions have been fulfilled, the [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink")
will send an assault to the player's base. This assault will consist of
2 squads, each made up of 19 [Hounds](Hound.md "wikilink").

When the assault arrives, the War Leader will give a speech, then order
the attack to begin, attacking gates and characters, and liberating
captives.

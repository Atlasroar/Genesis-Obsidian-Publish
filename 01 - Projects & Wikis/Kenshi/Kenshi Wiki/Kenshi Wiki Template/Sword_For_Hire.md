**This page is about character recruitment in [](Old_World.md). Please refer to the [](Playable_Characters.md) page for further links to
characters currently available.**

The Sword for Hire is available to become a follower. They function
exactly the same as the player created at the beginning. They can be
found in bars and can be hired for 700 Cats. They can also be customized
how you see fit. Once they have been hired the character customization
screen, they are as fully editable as the player. They can be given
weapons and equipment as well, simply hold right click and select
"Loot", this opens both the currently selected character, and the other
characters inventories for sharing between.

There are some other hire-able characters in Kenshi: Medic/Scientist,
Engineer, and fighter: these people are far more expensive (2500 Cats)
than regular swords for hire. However, as recompense for this fact, they
already have higher skill levels, a specific skill strength, and better
equipment. They are found in some bars, (usually two per bar) or
randomly in the wilderness.

## Sword for Hire Varieties

700 Cats

- All skills begin at Level 1.
- Normally start out with pants and Katana.

2,500 Cats (Medic, Engineer, Fighter)

- Medics start out at 40 [First Aid](Field_Medic.md "wikilink") and 20
  [Science](Science.md "wikilink") (but poor fighting skills). When hired,
  they start with 4 [](Advanced_First_Aid_Kit.md), and a [](Splint_Kit.md).
- Engineers start out with 40 [engineering](Engineer.md "wikilink") and 20
  [Labouring](Labouring.md "wikilink"). They don't have anything in their
  inventory when hired. The engineer will also mention that he is not
  shy of manual labour either, hence the 20 labouring.
- Fighters start out with 10 to every [skill](Statistics.md "wikilink").
  When hired, they start with a worn out [Topper](Topper.md "wikilink") for
  a weapon and a pair of pants.

  pants, and wields a Sabre-type weapon.

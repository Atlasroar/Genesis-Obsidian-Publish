Players who are interested in [growing](Farming.md "wikilink") and
[Crafting](Crafting.md "wikilink") [Items](Items.md "wikilink") for trading
should find this **Guide to Building an Outpost** helpful. Player
Outposts can be built just outside of towns or deep in the wilderness.

## Starting an Outpost

Different regions in [Kenshi](World_of_Kenshi.md "wikilink") offer very
different resources and dangers. Before starting an Outpost, players
should consider what they want to build and where they want to build it.

### Territory

Be careful of whose territory and what animals are nearby (Ex: Beak
Things in Vain)

Territory: will [tax collectors](Tax_Collector.md "wikilink") come bug you
(UC)

Even ruins can trigger base visits from the controlling faction (ex:
[Tiny Settlement](Tiny_Settlement.md "wikilink")).

Dangers: will raids from [Hostile Factions](Hostile_Factions.md "wikilink")
occur here (Ex: [Dust bandit](Dust_Bandits.md "wikilink") extortion)

If players are planning on [Armour Smithing](Armour_Smith.md "wikilink")
with [Leather](Leather.md "wikilink"), they should pick a location near
animals like [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") and
[Gorillos](Gorillo.md "wikilink").

### Prospecting

Find nearby resources with [Prospecting](Prospecting.md "wikilink").

Resources: copper, iron mines, [Environment](Environment.md "wikilink") for
farming.

Power: Can wind generators be used in this area? Or will you need to
research biofuel?

### Research

The player will only be able to build a couple of things before needing
to research additional [Technologies](Technology.md "wikilink"). If the
player decides to start their outpost before doing any research, the
only building they will be able to [Construct](Construction.md "wikilink")
for shelter will be a [Small Shack](Small_Shack.md "wikilink").

Alternatively, players can purchase a cheap building in a town and
research the necessary tech before starting.

After building a [Research Bench](Research_Bench.md "wikilink"), characters
can work at the bench to research. In order to build a Level 2 [](Research_Bench.md), characters must research [](Small_House_(Tech).md) and then [](Tech_Level_(Tech).md) 2. Studying these Technologies will
cost 8 [Books](Book.md "wikilink"). In order to determine how best to spend
[Research Artifacts](Research_Artifacts.md "wikilink"), it is recommended
that players research [Tech Levels](Tech_Level_(Tech).md "wikilink") before
spending Research Artifacts.

### Build Mode

In order to start construction, choose the building and then click to
place it. Confirm placement by clicking 'confirm.' The building will
change colors from blue (too close to a town) --\> red (unable to place)
--\> green (OK to place), indicating location suitability.

## Managing an Outpost

![](OutpostNaming.png "OutpostNaming.png") Players can rename their
outpost to whatever they want. Renaming an outpost affects the map
marker and the Event notifications.

### Types of Buildings

In build mode, buildings are split into these categories:

- Buildings (Building Shells)
- [Camping](Camping.md "wikilink")
- [Crafting](Crafting.md "wikilink")
- [Defence](Defensive_Structures.md "wikilink")
- [Farming](Farming.md "wikilink")
- Food
- Interior
- [Lights](Lighting.md "wikilink")
- Mining
- [Power](Power.md "wikilink")
- [Storage](Storage.md "wikilink")
- [Tech](Technology.md "wikilink")
- [Training](Training.md "wikilink")
- [Walls](Defensive_Structures.md "wikilink")

### Jobs

Players who want their outpost to function without constant
micromanaging should make use of the Jobs system. These are the
categories which jobs fall under:

- First Aid: this includes the Medic and Robotics jobs. They can be
  added through the medic button or when clicking to heal a character.
  These jobs remain active even when Jobs has been deselected for that
  character.
- Work: this includes all jobs where a character is using a machine or
  farm.
- Auto-Haul: when characters have these jobs active, they will carry
  items to the related [Storage](Storage.md "wikilink") building.
  Characters take these items from either their inventory or the
  building which generates it.
- Collection: players can give characters the job of finding dead bodies
  in order to bring them to a [](Corpse_Furnace.md) as well as the job of looting the
  bodies of fallen Animals.

## Visitors From Other Factions

### Trade Caravans

These traveling merchants provide the player with chances to buy and
sell goods while not having to venture to a city. Hive traders are a
common visitor in the Border Zone and often have a large amount of food,
materials, and plants to sell. They can facilitate starting or expanding
farms but at potentially inflated prices.

### Tax Collectors

Certain factions will send out squads to collect from player outposts.
The player can avoid conflict by responding a certain way to these
squads. If the player chooses to go against this faction, they might be
immediately attacked or the squad will retreat with the promise of
returning with an army.

- [Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") - Extortion
- [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") - [](Tribute_Round.md)
- [The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") - [](Prayer_Day.md)
- [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") - Tax men

### Base Raids

Certain fauna and factions may raid the player's base, these attacks are
all listed in [Base Assault](Base_Assault.md "wikilink").

Hostile factions may antagonize the player while the player is inside
their territory.

While not an actual raid, animals also pose a threat, potentially
attacking the player or eating their crops.

## Tips

- Insulate your base from the world. Rampaging fauna and factions have a
  much harder time doing damage if your base is behind a wall.
- Access to resources is important. If you can't sustain your population
  then you must have access to traders or to scavenge resources nearby.

### Recommended Start Areas

These are some areas where other players have already started their
bases.

[**Howler Maze**](Howler_Maze.md "wikilink")

- Fertile land (Green and some Arid) and good
  [Copper](Raw_Copper.md "wikilink") and [Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink")
  resources
- Endless source of meat from [Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink") (dangerous for
  weak characters), however no [Animal Skin](Animal_Skin.md "wikilink")
- Gut is a short travel to the west/southwest, for all your Beak Thing
  needs (Animal Skin and eggs)
- Easy trading access with UC/Traders Guild
- Black Scratch ([Tech Hunters](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink")) is fairly
  close, although shortest route is through Gut or via swimming
- [Acid rain](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") is infrequent enough to be
  easily managed.

Few patrols from major [Factions](Factions.md "wikilink"), although some
(including caravans) still visit. Reavers and sometimes Slave
Hunter/Trader raids do happen. Crab Raiders can also come to visit,
including to help you host a tournament. Good point to start thinking of
moving here is when fights in areas like [The Hub](The_Hub.md "wikilink")
become easy, with base locations here lasting into end game.

**[Okran's Pride](Okran's_Pride.md "wikilink")**

- Fertile Land and good Stone/Iron Resources (Copper deposits sparse and
  of low quality)
- Good Source of Raptors for Animal Skin and Meat
- Roving Paladin, High-Paladin, and Inquisitor squads do an excellent
  job keeping Holy Nation territory safe, killing wild animals and
  bandits. As such, Okran's Pride is a safe early building location for
  the new or the nervous.
- No taxes but, in exchange, you may need to participate in Prayer Day
  once a week. If you miss it, you'll be in trouble. If the prayer day
  squad happens to be defeated on their way to your base it may prevent
  any future prayer day events in the future.

The downside of building in Holy Nation territory, is that if you have
any character that isn't a Human male, you can expect some degree of
discrimination at the hands of the Holy Nation populace. Women tend to
be treated rather condescendingly, are forbidden from owning an outpost
without a Human male and have less persuasive power, but non-humans are
in for a bad time. If a Paladin spots a non-human outside of your base,
un-escorted by a Human, they will be attacked on sight. If a Paladin
spots non-humans in your outpost, they will request that you surrender
these party members to the service of Okran. You may avoid this by
giving your human a copy of The Holy Flame. You may then assure the
inquisitive Paladin that these non-human "beasts" are slaves to glorious
Okran. They will then leave you alone. Skeletons will always be attacked
on sight, keep them out of the Holy Nation. If you reach 50 relations
with the Holy Nation the Holy Nation will not bother your non-human
characters.

[**Fishman Island**](Fishman_Island.md "wikilink")

- Best soil for farming (Green and Swamp), continuous rain (seldom
  acidic)
- 2 spots with all resources at hand (copper, iron, stone, water)
- [Fishmen](Gurgler.md "wikilink") hordes can be tricky to deal with but a
  potential good asset for training
  - If you kill the Gurgler leader this causes Fishmen to no longer
    spawn on the island, replaced with only crabs.

Going to the island is a bit tricky (proximity of the Bonefields
harboring spiders and Beak Things as well as The Southern Hives) but
once there, you need to wall up and then you will have relative safety.
Once you found a way to deal with the locals, it's a smooth ride to have
a small plot of land evolve to full fledged powerhouse.

**[Leviathan Coast](Leviathan_Coast.md "wikilink")**

- Fertile land (Green and some Arid)
- Mass amounts of fauna including the deadly yet beautiful
  [Leviathans](Leviathan.md "wikilink")
- Great quality stone and iron deposits, however copper deposits are
  sparse and medium quality.
- Zone is quite far away from all starting areas and very inaccessible
  to all but mid-end level characters.
- Beware as you are subject to [Cannibal](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") raids
  wherever you are in the zone.

Once you are here, you have to worry about Cannibal raids and, depending
on your affiliated faction, raids from the Holy Nation. Besides these,
however, you will also be sought out by the
[Hiver](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") caravans to the south in
[Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink"). It is hard living, but very bountiful if you
can get a base up and running.

**[Shem](Shem.md "wikilink")**

- The promised land
- Pros:
  - Large number of resources, both Iron and Copper.
  - Easy to occupy land with many fields of 100-richness stone.
  - Large tracts of flat or mostly flat land for all your megalopolis
    projects, while also accommodating snug little camps.
  - Roaming bands of [Garrus](Garru.md "wikilink"), as well as small squads
    of [Beak things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink"). Free meat and skins!
  - Low bandit population. Mostly starving bandits, with the occasional
    [Band of Bones](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md "wikilink") party.
  - No solicitors, besides [](Black_Dragon_Ninjas.md) if you've let them live so
    far (but you'll have a very early warning).
  - Somehow caravans still come by easily and frequently.
  - The lakes make for a nice natural complement to your walls.
  - And what a view!
- Cons:
  - Arid climate. Mitigated by high fertility, so you can still reliably
    grow hemp and wheatstraw next to your cacti.
  - Awkward roads around the area. Roaming NPCs rarely visit (unless a
    custom mod with additional tracks is created).
  - Annoying cliffs make a complete surrounding wall require some
    creative angles.
  - Somewhat far from cities. [Flats Lagoon](Flats_Lagoon.md "wikilink")
    can be accessed by skirting the south of [Venge](Venge.md "wikilink"),
    others requiring full day trips.
  - Also, pretty isolated from scavenging spots. Nonetheless a peaceful,
    central location to return home to after expeditions.

[**Northern Coast**](Northern_Coast.md "wikilink")

- Recommended base location: To the left of the [](Fishing_Village.md), near the water, there is a
  copper and iron ore node there.

<!-- -->

- Pros:
  - Mix of Arid and Green environment and good fertility allowing for
    the growth of every crop in the game except for
    [Riceweed](Riceweed.md "wikilink"). This allows for production of
    several goods to be sold at a profit and sufficient food.
  - Plentiful Stone and Iron along with sufficient Copper scattered
    around.
  - The only negative faction [event](Events.md "wikilink") that will occur
    is [Cannibals](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") coming to raid you and [](River_Raptor.md) eating your crops.
  - [World's End](World's_End.md "wikilink") is close by and a very big
    city which should fulfill your needs for merchants with money and
    the need of purchasing certain resources for yourself. For quick
    trips, the [Fishing Village](Fishing_Village.md "wikilink") is right
    next to you, it has a Bar and a [](Travel_Supplies_Shops.md). You can easily purchase
    food there.
  - Being near the edge of the map gives you quick access to an [](Ancient_Ruins.md)
  - Recruits are plentiful considering there are multiple bars located
    around here, in [World's End](World's_End.md "wikilink"), [](Fishing_Village.md) and [](Flotsam_Village.md).
  - If you prefer to mine to make money before building up your base,
    you can easily do this in [](Flotsam_Village.md) which has a bunch of ore nodes
    close to it, one of which (I think) can be mined from inside the
    village itself, making you safe from most attacks, if you get
    attacked while mining a bit further away you can run here to get
    defended by the guards.
  - To avoid dying from the cannibal raids you can hire mercenaries from
    [World's End](World's_End.md "wikilink"), there are multiple squads
    there if you want extra safety. You can also run and lure the
    cannibals to the [Fishing Village](Fishing_Village.md "wikilink") but
    the population there although able to take care of themselves, will
    slowly start to die off the more you do this. You will make a lot of
    money from the production of goods here, so money should be
    plentiful to hire lots of mercenaries.
  - If you want to, you can utilize the water in your base building to
    force entry via swimming, this takes a while to do meaning enemies
    will take a while to get into your base, if you setup turret guards
    they will kill everyone trying to enter before they get inside.

<!-- -->

- Cons:
  - [Cannibals](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") are reasonably tough and take your
    squad away to be eaten at their camps if someone gets knocked
    unconscious. You may one second not be paying attention and then you
    see one of your character's name in the distance and you realize
    he's being carried by a cannibal to their camp for dinner. You may,
    due to this, occasionally have to sneak out of the camp with that
    character or help him with the other members.
  - Other cities are very far away, making exploration or acquisition of
    specific items annoying due to long travel times.
  - [River Raptors](River_Raptor.md "wikilink") will eat your crops
    sometimes.
  - Sometimes, light [Acid Rain](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") will fall.
    The one that falls here doesn't do much damage as it is considered
    "Light", no one in your party should die because of it, but it can
    be annoying to have damaged party members if a fight is about to
    happen.
  - Due to how easy it is to survive and make money here, it is actually
    a bit boring, which might be the biggest "con" of all.

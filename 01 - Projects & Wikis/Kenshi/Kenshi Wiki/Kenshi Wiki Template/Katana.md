This weapon has inventory dimensions of **1x7**. It can be equipped in
both the primary and secondary weapon slots.

## Trivia

- Based on the [katana](wikipedia:katana "wikilink") (刀) which is one
  of the traditionally made swords used in feudal Japan.
- *Katana* is carried in its scabbard with the curved sharp edge facing
  up, while *tachi* was usually worn with the curve sharpened edge
  facing down.
- Most authentic *katana* and *tachi* blades can be distinguished by the
  signature of the swordsmith on the *nakago* (the "handle" part of the
  blade that gets wrapped in the actual hilt). When carried on the left
  waist, the signature (though covered in the hilt) faces outwards, and
  thus the two blades are distinguishable due to the different facing of
  the curved side (i.e. when place flat on the ground with signature
  facing up and sword pointing away from the observer, the katana blade
  will curve rightwards, while tachi will curve leftwards).
- When worn together with the *wakizashi*, the pair of swords is known
  as **daishō** (大小) which literally means "*big-little*".

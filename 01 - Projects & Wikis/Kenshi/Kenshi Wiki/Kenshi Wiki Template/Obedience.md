**Obedience** is a location in the northern section of the [](Fog_Islands.md). As you approach Obedience, the area
becomes much darker.

It appears to be situated in a massive quarry, which still has
scaffolding that stands to this day. Around the "lake" of what seems
like ice, you may find gigantic skeleton heads and their upper bodies.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") or [](Minor_Outposts.md) in Obedience. This zone does not
spawn [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps.

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink")

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

- [Iron Spider](Iron_Spider.md "wikilink")
- [Broken Skeleton](Broken_Skeleton.md "wikilink")

## Environment

The fertility rates in Obedience are 0% for Arid and Green, but that's
to be expected from a solid metal surface. There are also no resources
like iron or copper available, indicating that the metal floor is
neither.

### Weather

*This zone does not have seasons. No weather should spawn in this area.*

## Lore Speculation

It is implied that when the humans became fearful or had no use for
their creations, they marched the skeletons into a quarry they dug for
themselves. Afterwards, the humans (or perhaps skeletons under their
command?) filled it with some sort of chemical agent, ultimately
"killing" or destroying/freezing most of them where they stood. This
theory of the use of chemicals is reinforced by the thick white fog that
surrounds Obedience and the islands, as well as the hazardous atmosphere
that forces people to wear masks. Likely it was similar to a cryogenic
compound or liquid hydrogen, which gave off a deadly gas as time went
on.

The giant robots themselves seem to be encased in metal, as characters
will state that "The ground is solid metal... totally smooth".

Despite the mass decommissioning of Behemoths, it appears that at least
one [Behemoth](Stobe.md "wikilink") still lives after this incident.

Another lore element to consider is the references to the oceans being
several hundred metres higher than they are now. The sunken lake at the
bottom could be a liquefaction pool. When the waters dropped, it pulled
sand with it effectively forming quicksand. This would explain the
rusted remains being trapped, the sunken nature of the environment and
the method of death; obediently walking deep into the water where they
would corrode and eventually fail. This does not explain the metal floor
or the fog, however other lore elements can.

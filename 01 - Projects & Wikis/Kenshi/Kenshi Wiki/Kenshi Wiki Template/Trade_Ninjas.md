The **Trade Ninjas** are the faction which owns bars in [](The_Hub.md), [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink") and the [](Rebel_Base.md). They act as the guards of each location,
often attacking any [Dust Bandit](Dust_Bandits.md "wikilink"), [](Starving_Bandits.md) or [Bonedog](Bonedog.md "wikilink")
that wanders near their property, as well as anybody who causes a
disturbance in their bars.

## Locations

## Trivia

- Although the Trade Ninjas are the sole occupants of Rebel Base, the
  [Holy Nation Outlaws](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md "wikilink") are listed in
  the FCS as the ones actually owning the settlement.
- The Trade Ninjas are implied to be the "shadowy figures" mentioned in
  [Ludin's Reports](Ludin's_Reports.md "wikilink"), who dissuaded the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) from reoccupying the Hub. Despite
  using violent means to scare the Holy Nation away, they aren't hostile
  to (or enemies of) the Holy Nation in gameplay.

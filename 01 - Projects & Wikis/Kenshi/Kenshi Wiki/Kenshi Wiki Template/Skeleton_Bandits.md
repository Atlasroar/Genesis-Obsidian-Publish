**Skeleton Bandits** is a faction native to the southeast corner of the
continent. They primarily consist of
[Greenlanders](Greenlander.md "wikilink") wearing [](Skeleton_Mask.md). They are lead by
[Elder](Elder.md "wikilink"), a [P4 Unit](P4_Unit.md "wikilink") who enjoys
watching humans massacre each other. Elder has brainwashed his human
followers into believing that they are [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink").

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

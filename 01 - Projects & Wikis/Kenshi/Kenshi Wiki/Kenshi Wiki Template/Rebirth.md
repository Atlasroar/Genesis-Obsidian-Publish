**Rebirth** is a slave town where [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) sends corrupted beings so that they
can become worthy enough to reincarnate as a [Human](Human.md "wikilink"),
or otherwise the humans that have committed crimes against Okran and are
sent here for punishment and repentance.
[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") are not enslaved here, as The Holy
Nation does not consider them to have a soul. It is located in an
[eponymous region](Rebirth_(Zone).md "wikilink") north of main Holy Nation
territory.

Players can sell or donate characters into slavery at this location.
Non-player characters, be they [Fishmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink"),
[Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") or [](Dust_Bandits.md) will be accepted for a token price of
500 cats if the player specifically asks for compensation otherwise
donating will yield +1 reputation with [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). Players can also free enslaved
characters from their shackles, and as with all freed slaves there is a
chance they will join the player's squad as they leave the area.

You can start your game in Rebirth with two characters if you choose
"The Slaves" [game start](Game_Starts.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- Considering that a vast majority of the slaves in Rebirth are
  [Sheks](Shek.md "wikilink"), it is likely that many of them are captured
  prisoners of war from the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") or
  rogue bandits such as [Berserkers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink") and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md).
- If the [player](Nameless.md "wikilink") was enslaved by The Holy Nation
  or the [Slavemongers](Slavemonger.md "wikilink"), they will be sent here.
- Although lore-wise Skeletons are not supposed to be enslaved, gameplay
  mechanics would still make the HN enslave or imprison any Skeletons
  nearby.

The **Naginata Katana**is a variation on the
[Naginata](Naginata.md "wikilink"), with a slightly shorter reach, and a
hybrid of properties from the Naginata and
[Katanas](Katanas.md "wikilink").

While the Naginata Katana's bonus against animals is not as large as the
Naginata, its bonus against humanoids and sweeping attacks make it
effective in regions where poorly armoured humanoids are found in large
numbers, such as the [Cannibal Plains](Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink"), [](Fog_Islands.md) and the [](Fishman_Island.md).

This weapon has inventory dimensions of **1x9**, meaning it can only be
equipped as a primary weapon.

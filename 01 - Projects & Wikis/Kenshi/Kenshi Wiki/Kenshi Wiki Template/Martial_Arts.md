**Martial arts** is a hard skill to train at first. Most enemies can
knock you down before you ever become a true threat; however, with the
right time and training, a martial artist can become a potent ally. As
characters level up in the Martial arts skill, they will gain new
attacks. This is a unique trait as no other "weapon" gains new attacks
as skills increase. Martial Arts has the largest damage output of any
weapon in the game but suffers from a short reach on its "weapon" as
well as animations as a trade off.

Martial Arts is a very dangerous combat method to train because
characters engaging in 'unarmed combat' can be injured through their
attacker's hits as well as when landing their own hits. [](Robot_Limbs.md) are incredible useful as they will
prevent taking recoil damage when attacking as well as boosting damage
([Lifter Arms](Industrial_Lifter_Arm_(left).md "wikilink")) by a massive
degree. Certain armor can negate fist damage during attacks. As a
character becomes a seasoned Martial Artist, they progressively will
take less damage from landing hits. Because
[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") already have Robot Limbs they do not
receive recoil damage so they can make good Martial Artists without much
investment.

-Although Soldierbots have a negative multiplier for Martial Arts they
gain the same experience as any other race in the skill.

## Training

As with Melee Fighting skills, the XP rate of Martial Arts is connected
to [Stronger Opponent Logic](Stronger_Opponent_Logic.md "wikilink"). As
such fighting an opponent with a higher defense level (Or Martial Arts)
than your Martial Arts level will result in more experience, while
facing someone who is weaker results in less. Wearing
[Equipment](Equipment.md "wikilink") which increases Martial Arts stats
will result in less stressful battles but much longer training time
because of this. The fastest way to train Martial Arts is to wear
Martial Arts reducing Armour and overencumbering yourself.

Some armour which gives Martial Arts stat boosts are: [](Martial_Artist_Bindings.md), [](Gi_Pants.md), [Gi](Gi.md "wikilink"), [](Assassin's_Rags.md), and [](Sleeveless_Dustcoat.md). Additionally, fighting
indoors provides a +8 level boost to martial arts.

## Self-Inflicted damage (Recoil)

The damage you take when using Martial Arts depends on what you are
hitting, their armour "material" (Shown on the top right) which you hit
as well as your Martial Arts and Toughness level. Robots do not take any
recoil damage for using Martial Arts.

- Recoil damage you take for hitting a non-skeleton in a bodypart which
  has nothing, \[cloth\] or \[leather\] material armour (or if their
  armour fails to "cover" them) is;
  - Cut = 0
  - Stun = 1-((Martial Arts + Toughness) x 0.005)
- Recoil damage you take for hitting a non-skeleton in a bodypart which
  has \[chain\] material armour is;
  - Cut = 1-((Martial Arts + Toughness) x 0.005)
  - Stun = 1-((Martial Arts + Toughness) x 0.005)
- Recoil damage you take for hitting a Skeleton (Regardless of armour)
  or a non-skeleton in a bodypart which has \[Metal Plates\] material
  armour is;
  - Cut = 2-((Martial Arts + Toughness) x 0.01)
  - Stun = 2-((Martial Arts + Toughness) x 0.01)

Non-Skeletons must use robotic limbs, fist protection (up to the % they
require) or reach a total of 200 combined Martial Arts + Toughness to
prevent recoil damage. (Although "fist protection" may seem like it only
affects your arms, it works for all of your limbs) Regardless of your
total level or Robotic limbs, non-skeletons will always do 0.6x damage
when dealing Martial Arts damage to robots.

## Skill cap

Hard cap is achieved when one of the xp multipliers becomes 0 or so
close to zero that it rounds down the final xp gain to zero.

### Hard cap breakpoints

1.  100.7722
2.  553 (Not possible for the player to achieve this in the base game.
    The only NPCs who can level their Martial Arts this high are ones
    who spawn above ~101.23 and none of those who do
    ([Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink")) are recruitable)

## Combat Techniques

Combat Techniques for Martial Arts are only usable if specific limbs are
not crippled. If you lack an arm or your arm is below 0 health, you will
be unable to use Bad Punch, but can still use kicklow (as an example)
provided you have the required skill level. Once you reach higher levels
of Martial arts, some are abandoned and will not be used again. Combat
Techniques have power assigned for their attacks and some have 2
"techniques" which means they have two damaging attacks in the
animation. If a Combat Technique below lists two under the Power of
attacks section, that is why. Possible targets hit are the max units an
attack can damage at once. Highly unlikely to ever actually hit 99, but
still important to list so players can know if an attack will lead them
open or may stagger other enemies currently attacking them. Depending on
your Encumberance % (shown at the bottom left, right above Martial Arts
in game) you will be unable to perform certain Combat Techniques if you
are over the limit. Any Combat Technique with a value over 100 can
always be used at any Encumberance % as 100 is the maximum you can
reach.

## Damage

Damage that is done while using Martial Arts depends on three skills:
Martial Arts, [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink"), and
[Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink"). The damage done with a 100 power
attack by Martial arts is
(2.5+0.075MA)+(2.5+0.075MA)(0.1Strength)+(2.5+0.075MA)(0.08Toughness) .
Fill in your Martial Arts, Strength and Toughness levels (Even the
percent, so level 10 with 31 % would be 10.31) to calculate the damage
done with a 100 power attack against an enemy with 50 Toughness. This
formula is for total damage and cannot tell you the exact amount of cut
to blunt damage. Skeletons do NOT do bonus Martial Arts damage compared
to other races, however they do deal full damage to robotic foes. Other
races do only 60% damage to robotic units with their fists even if they
replace them with robotic limbs.

Important to add that [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink") will only affect
your attack speed. The +unarmed damage found on some robotics limbs have
no actual use and do not affect damage in any way. The only two limbs
which increase your damage for Martial Arts are Industrial Lifter Arms
and KLR Series Arms as they boost your Strength. For the highest damage
output use two Masterwork Industrial Lifter Arms.

Despite not being a weapon and not weighing anything in your inventory,
Martial Arts does have a required Strength Level as though it was a
normal weapon. Unlike normal weapons, though, its required level will
shift over time with your Martial Arts skill. The level of strength
needed is equivalent to 80% your Martial Arts skill level (Divide your
Martial Arts level by 50 to get the damage value, then multiply that by
40 to get the required Strength level). Because of this, it may be
better to train Strength up a lot before even starting to work on
Martial Arts if you wish to attack at a normal speed.

## Trivia

- For the damage calculation Toughness is 0.08 instead of 0.1 like
  Strength because of the "unarmed damage mult" under GLOBAL CONSTANTS
  in FCS being set to 0.8. It states that it is the "global multiplier ,
  affects all damage calculations for this damage type", however it only
  affects Toughness damage scaling for Martial Arts.
- The 0.65 Damage Multiplier (not to be confused with damage resistance
  from Toughness) applied to "all damage calculations" does not affect
  Martial Arts.
- At level 0 Martial arts, Strength and Toughness using a 100 power
  attack you deal 0 cut and 2.5 blunt damage. With 100 Martial arts, 0
  Stength and Toughness this goes up to 6 cut and 4 blunt.
  - If it was possible to level past 100 in Martial Arts the damage
    gained for each level would go up by a massive amount past around
    the 160 mark and would do only cut damage.
- Over Encumbering yourself will lower your Martial Arts, based off a
  percent. Every 1% Encumbrance is equal to -0.8% Martial arts. So -80%
  Martial arts at 100%, which is also the cap as you cannot go above
  100% Encumbrance.
- Backpacks do not reduce your Martial Arts level, as such you are able
  to use a Thieves Backpack instead of a Small one without being
  negatively impacted.
- Skeletons have a bloodloss of 0.2 on their fists which is four times
  that of any biological race using Martial Arts... however 0.2
  bloodloss is only twice that of a Jitte. So this is not really an
  advantage over the other races.
- "FISTS" and "FISTS -robo" have a length (Reach) of 18.

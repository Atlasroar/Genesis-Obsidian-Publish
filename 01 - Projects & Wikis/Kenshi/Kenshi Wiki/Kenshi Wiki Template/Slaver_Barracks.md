**Slaver Barracks** is a barracks specifically found in slave farms and
camps. This variant is part of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) faction. Despite being called a
'Slaver Bar' in the game, it is not one, functioning more of a Barracks
where slavers relax in town. There is a similarly named [](Slaver_Bar.md) that functions as a real bar.

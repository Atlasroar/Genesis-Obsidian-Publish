The **Scavenger's Basket** is a lightweight
[backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") that is unable to stack [](Trade_Goods.md) and has an average space of 10x14 grid
tiles. This is the same amount of space as a [](Medium_Backpack.md) and a [](Thieves_Backpack.md). From all backpacks available,
this is the most affordable bag.

Compared to the Medium Backpack, the Medium has a higher encumbrance
reduction of 50%, but a higher weight of 4kg, compared to 30% and 1kg
for the Scavenger. As a result, when more than 15kg is being carried
inside a bag, the total encumbrance for a Medium Backpack will be
better. The combat penalties for both bags are the same.

Comparing a Scavenger's Bag to a Thieves Backpack, both of them have the
same amount of space and they both have the same Athletics modifier. The
Thieves' weight only 1 kg heavier and is 10x or 20x times more
expensive, but that is compensated by a higher encumbrance reduction of
60%, -2 combat skill penalty compared to -5 and a 1.00 modifier for
combat speed, stealth and dodge. As a result, the Thieves backpack is a
far better backpack worn during combat.

This basket can be commonly bought from [](Item_Trader.md) or looted from [](Holy_Farmer_Wife.md).

**Scrawny Cannibals** are the weakest members of the
[Cannibal](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") faction. Scrawny Cannibals can be found
roaming the [Cannibal Plains](Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink") and
[Darkfinger](Darkfinger.md "wikilink") in large groups.

Scrawny Cannibals are visually distinct from the stronger
[Cannibal](Cannibal.md "wikilink") character because they have yellow body
paint instead of red. Similarly to their stronger counterparts, the
genders of Scrawny Cannibals are differentiated by the pattern of their
war paint/tribal markings. Males wear darker paint around their legs and
have a rib cage-like bone marking on their upper torso. A female's paint
is all done in a yellow pattern, with a pattern on their stomach that
looks somewhat suspiciously similar to [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) symbol.

They are also significantly smaller when it comes to body size, almost
giving them the appearance of teenagers.

If they are near a Cannibal Camp, Scrawny Cannibals will carry KO'd
characters to be imprisoned in the camp. If they are not close enough to
a camp, they will leave the unconscious character on the ground.

Despite living in harsh conditions, Scrawny Cannibals are equipped with
simple [Basic First Aid Kits](Basic_First_Aid_Kit.md "wikilink"), which
means that they are aware of the dangers of having open wounds or
passing out in their unsafe neighborhood and/or they want to bandage up
the victims they captured for them to be alive and keep their 'meat
fresh'.

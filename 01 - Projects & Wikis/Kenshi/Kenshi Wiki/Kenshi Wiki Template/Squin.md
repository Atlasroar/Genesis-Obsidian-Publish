**Squin** is a [Major Town](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") in the [](Border_Zone.md) housed in a narrow canyon. It is
controlled by the [Shek Kingdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") and is located
directly east of their capital, [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink"). Its location
can be revealed by exploring or by reading the **[Map](Maps.md "wikilink")
of the Shek Kingdom**.

There are [Iron Resources](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink") and [](Copper.md) that can be mined nearby. Also, [](Dust_Bandits.md) and [](Hungry_Bandit.md) roam the region and will harass
unsuspecting wanderers.

The entire town is powered entirely by [wind energy](Power.md "wikilink").
With a lack of batteries in the city, power outages are to be expected
fairly frequently as the wind speed naturally oscillates.

There is also a chance for a player to encounter some [](Unique_Recruits.md) inside the bar here, such as
[Horse](Horse.md "wikilink"), [Oron](Oron.md "wikilink"), [](Rane_the_Giant.md), [Ruka](Ruka.md "wikilink") and
[Kang](Kang.md "wikilink").

The [Flotsam Ninjas](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") pacifier can be found
here.

**Savant** is the crazed Leader of the [](Skin_Bandits.md) with a bounty of 80,000 cats by the
[United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), despite the listing of a
50,000 bounty on his [wanted poster](Wanted_Posters.md "wikilink"). Savant
can usually be found on his throne in [](Skinhouse_HQ.md). You can join his faction as a
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink").

He has a Maniacal [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

Savant also holds a special blueprint named the "Skeleton-Human
Transformation Bible" which allows the player to craft [](Human_Skin_Suit.md) and the [](Peeler_Machine.md).

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If **Savant** is killed or imprisoned, it will cause the Skinhouse HQ to
be completely destroyed. One of the [Skinhouses](Skinhouse.md "wikilink")
is also destroyed while the other is taken over by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md) if the [](Queen_of_the_South.md) is still alive.

The skin bandit patrols also stop and are replaced by a Southern Hive
patrol of 1 [Prince](Prince.md "wikilink") and 8
[Droneguards](Droneguard.md "wikilink") if the **Queen of the South** is
alive and free.

This will also cause the Skin Bandit raids ([](Skin_Harvest.md) and [](The_Big_Skin_Harvest.md)) on a [](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md) to stop.

## Interactions

Talking to Savant as a non-human allows the player to discover more
about the "philosophy" of the skinned ones.

Savant is of the opinion that the cinders that spread everywhere from
the [Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink") are toxic to all minds. He claims
human skin helps protect them against these cinders; However, because
some still manage to slip through our wounds and by breathing, we humans
engage in pleasurable activities such as eating and drinking to release
"healing byproducts" in our bodies, purifying them from the cinders and
"resetting our bad moral judgement".

Due to the skeletons having no skin, as well as their "extra components"
and inability to laugh, eat or engage in any kind of pleasurable
activity, Savant believes they are the race most prone to succumbing to
the madness-inducing cinders, supporting his theory with the large
number of rampaging "mad" skeletons present in the ashlands. Thus the
self-proclaimed Doctor Savant came up with an inventive procedure to
give skin and soul to skeletons, and give them some sorely-needed cinder
protection.

[Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink") and [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") seeking to join
the Skin Bandits will be disappointed to find out that Savant only
"operates" on skeletons, while [humans](Human.md "wikilink") who manage to
sneak all the way to Savant and talk to him will leave him baffled at
their stupidity/insanity, and cause him to call on his [](Skin_Bandit.md) for fresh skin.

## Trivia

After he is killed or imprisoned, random [Drifters](Drifters.md "wikilink")
in bars will have a new conversation:


**Drifter 1:** "Apparently the Skin Eater was just some poor guy held
hostage by a bunch of skeleton cultists..."

**Drifter 2:** "Did you hear about their suits?"

**Drifter 2:** "Made of human skin!"

**Drifter 2:** "I'm talking straight up CHUNKS of people stitched
together..."

**Drifter 1:** "And that, my friends, is why I never travel south..."

**Drifter 1:** "No thank YOU very much."

## Tips

- If you approach him while he is sleeping you can just pick him up and
  take his gear/turn him in for his bounty.

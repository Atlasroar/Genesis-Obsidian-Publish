**Old Map** is a [Junk](Junk.md "wikilink") item: no purpose other than
trading and only worth a small amount. This item can be found in [](Lost_Library.md) along with [](Damaged_Book.md) and [Parchment](Parchment.md "wikilink").

This item might actually be a real map of the way the continent in
Kenshi was before much of the landscape was altered and polluted. The
player characters in Kenshi describe it as 'probably fictional' because
it does not match current Kenshi landscape. [ru:Старая
карта](ru:Старая_карта "wikilink")

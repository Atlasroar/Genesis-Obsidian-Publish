**Griffin** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink") found in
any [Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") bar. He believes he had a
vision from [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink"), who showed him that he would meet
a wealthy wanderer, and that wanderer would lead him to the truth of the
First Extinction. Whether or not you believe him, he believes this
wanderer is you and asks for 9,000 Cats as proof of your wealth.

While he is a former soldier of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), he is not as prejudiced against the
other [Races](Races.md "wikilink"), and is willing to travel with them. He
also does not necessarily believe that the
[Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink") were the cause of the First Extinction,
like the Holy Nation proclaims.

He is a very good human recruit for melee combat, as he has a 20 for
melee attack and defence, a 20 in all melee weapon stats except
polearms, and a 20 in strength and dexterity. This makes him a reliable
and very versatile recruit for combat purposes, as he can competently
use almost any melee weapon without having to train his stats first,
although keep in mind his non-combat stats are abysmal, so there will be
a time investment required if you plan to use him for something like
mining or farming in-between fighting. It's also worth noting that his
athletics skill is also 20, which is plenty enough to outrun enemies
like [Starving Bandits](Starving_Bandits.md "wikilink") and
[Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink").

He has an [Honorable](Personality.md "wikilink") personality, his own
unique dialogue package, and several lines of unique dialogue.

He can be found in [Bad Teeth](Bad_Teeth.md "wikilink") as long as it has
not been taken over by another faction. He can be found in the original
[Blister Hill](Blister_Hill.md "wikilink") as well as the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) controlled [](Blister_Hill,_Flotsam_Ninjas.md). He may have a chance of
being in [Drin](Drin.md "wikilink") if it is taken over by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). He can be in
[Stack](Stack.md "wikilink") if it is in its original state or possibly in
ruins.

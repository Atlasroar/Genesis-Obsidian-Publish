center}}The **Beak Thing Egg** is an obscure Animal Product
[item](items.md "wikilink"). Eggs can only be found in
the [nests](Nest.md "wikilink") of [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink").
They are decently valuable and can be sold to any
[trader](Traders.md "wikilink"). Due to the eggs' weight and space, it is
difficult to carry many of them by one character.

A particularly good area to acquire these items is from
[Gut](Gut.md "wikilink"). [](Nest_of_Beak_Things.md) are easy to spot and plentiful in
this environment, plus one is in close proximity to numerous cities that
these can be sold to, such as [Brink](Brink.md "wikilink") and
[Heng](Heng.md "wikilink").

It is not possible to grow pets from the eggs, but during development
the Devs have hinted that it may be implemented in
[future](Kenshi_2.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

Given the description of the egg, one could speculate that the nobles
have a taste for this type of egg. [ru:Яйцо клювастой

**Bayan** is an advisor to the [Stone Golem](Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") of
[Shek Kingdom](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink"). He can be found in the Faction
HQ in [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink"), unless World States have moved the Shek
HQ.

He has a Fearful [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

Bayan is supposedly the one who influenced Queen Esata's decision to
make peace with [United Cities](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") in order to
reverse the slow decline of the [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink") population.

## Interactions

**Bayan**can be talked to in order to propose an alliance with the Shek.
He will only agree if the player is an enemy of [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), or has slain the
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") or [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md). Additionally, he will claim that
the player has already earned their camaraderie if they have more than
50 relations with the Shek. You cannot be 50 or more with the following
factions in order to ally with the Shek: Holy Nation, Slave Traders,
Trader's Guild, or United Cities

He can be given the Bugmaster, Phoenix, [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) and [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) for their bounties and
relations with the Shek.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

**Bayan's**only world-state is when he is killed or kidnapped by the
player. This will cause a large assault on the player with [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) herself at the lead and a
few of [The Five Invincibles](The_Five_Invincibles.md "wikilink") in tow
along with a large number of [](Hundred_Guardian.md).

## Trivia

- While technically non-canon, the lead writer for Kenshi, Natalie,
  wrote a [short story about
  Bayan](https://bloodandwhine.blogspot.com/2017/06/bayans-story_24.html?m=0).

## Tips

- If your goal is to eliminate (or simply defeat) Esata and her
  Invincibles, be sure to focus on downing Bayan first. His high level
  of Strength and Martial Arts should not be taken lightly. Thankfully
  he has a pitiful level of Toughness.

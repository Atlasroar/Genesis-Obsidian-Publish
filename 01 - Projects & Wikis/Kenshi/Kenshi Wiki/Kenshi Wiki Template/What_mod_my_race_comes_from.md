Wondering what mod is the mother of your race?

I have made two Google Sheets covering 152 most popular race mods and
their 468 individual races for my CBT animations patch mod.

It is not complete all races inclusive list, but maybe your race is one
of these, then you'll know the mod it came from.

<https://bit.ly/3xW7ECg> Massive CBT Animations to Races Patch :
Included Race Mods List. Has the mod file name and the Steam Page name.

Included Individual Races List. Has the mod file name and the race name.

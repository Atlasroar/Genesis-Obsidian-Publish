The **Heavy Polearm** is an armour piercing
[Polearm](Polearm.md "wikilink") focused on cut damage.

This weapon has inventory dimensions of **1x10**, meaning it can only be
equipped as a primary weapon.

A [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") version of this weapon can be found on
[Screamer the False](Screamer_the_False.md "wikilink") in the [](Tower_of_Abuse.md).

Curiously, the Heavy Polearm is not wielded by any NPC besides Screamer.
Non-Meitou variants can only be found in animal nests, as artifact
spawns or bought in stores.

**Camp Bed** is a building that can be placed (via the "Build Menu")
anywhere outside the borders of towns or even in [](Player-Owned_Buildings_in_Town.md) in town. It is
used in the same way as a normal [Bed](Bed.md "wikilink"). Once you've
rested, it can be deconstructed to be used over and over again. Like
other [Camping](Camping.md "wikilink") buildings, its "construction" does
not create a [player outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink").
When slept in your recover organic health 4x faster and blood/oil twice
as fast as normal.

**Camp Bed** is essentially an unfolded [](Sleeping_Bag.md) (an item).

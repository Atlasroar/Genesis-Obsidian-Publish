Sabina was an author that wrote the books [](Mass_Extinction_Series.md), [](The_Lost_Ancients_Series.md), and [](Okranite_Theories_In_Relation_To_Findings_Series.md). Little
is known about Sabina since Sabina doesn't exist as an NPC that players
can interact with, however, it's likely that Sabina was a
[Machinist](Machinists.md "wikilink") and that Sabina is possibly dead
(hence the lack of an NPC). Sabina's is cited by
[Finch](Finch.md "wikilink") in [](The_Lost_Ancients_Series.md).

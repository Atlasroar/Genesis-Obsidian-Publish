As of patch .24, you are able to construct buildings and interior items.
All construction must occur outside of a town, except for interior items
that may be build in buildings that have been purchased in a town, and
requires [Building Materials](Building_Materials.md "wikilink"). Some
features of buildings (as of patch .26.9) include lockable doors and
storage, as well as beds for resting and healing wounds. For a list of
buildings please see the [Buildings List](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") .

As of patch .47.0, all buildings will require the player to purchase
blueprints.  Some blueprints, such as the base starter blueprint, will
give the player multiple buildings to construct, while others are
specific only to one building type.

As of version (¿?) you can only place a small shack as a starter
building, then you have to research the next levels in a Research bench,
also, some advanced forms of buildings require certain special items and
blueprints. You can place the buildings when in building mode to see the
location of your buildings but note that you won't be able to build them
if you don't have enough building materials.

## Beginning Construction

To begin construction you must have "Building Materials" in your
inventory. After finding a suitable location for your building outside
of town, you may begin. The "Build" button on the bottom right breaks
down into three categories.

- Buildings - Basic structures such as outposts, saloons, houses, etc.
- <span style="line-height:21px;">Interior - Interior items can only be
  places inside of buildings. Includes things such as beds and
  cages.</span>
- <span style="line-height:21px;">Storage - Includes all storage
  containers such as Equipment stands and storage chests.</span>

Once you have selected the item to construct, you will be presented with
a phantom copy of the building to select its placement.
A<span style="color:#008000;"> **green **</span>colored ghost means the
placing is valid and you can construct your building there.
A<span style="color:#800000;"> **red **</span>ghost indicates an invalid
placement (either because it's too close to a town or there are
obstructions on the terrain, such as, for example, player characters).
A<span style="color:#000080;"> **blue **</span>ghost indicates that the
construction is too close to a town (which also means you can't build
your own nook inside a town) or that it is an "interior" building
and needs to be constructed inside a larger building. A bed, for
example, can only be constructed inside a player-owned building.

## Construction Phase

Once you have placed your building, you will be presented with a
wireframe model of the building. This wireframe is where you will be
placing aforementioned "Building Materials", and sending your men to
construct the building.

When attempting to build there are some things to remember.

- The building materials will be "added" to building, so everyone can
  help, not just those with building materials on them.
- You do not need all of the building materials at once. You can start
  the building, and then go to towns to pick up more materials.
- If a character can't fit all of the building materials in his
  inventory or in his backpack for the larger buildings, if he's set to
  be an engineer as a Perma-job he will automatically go gather them
  from the closest storage of your property.
- Your building will now be marked on the map as a minor settlement.

You can click on the building, which will show an information panel in
the bottom right. Information about the progress of the building, as
well as the current materials inside of it.

Once the condition bar is filled, the building is complete and usable.

If you want to repair a building, you will need to have a certain amount
of building materials (based on the damage made) in your inventory, but
the systems works just as in constructing.

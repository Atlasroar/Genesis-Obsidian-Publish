**Medical Supplies** are a [trade good](Trade_Goods.md "wikilink") that can
be bought and sold to make a profit. They aren't needed in the crafting
of any [medical items](Medical_Items.md "wikilink") and cannot be used for
healing.

Given the fact that medical supplies are not really used for of patching
up the wounded, one could speculate that they are more of an ancient
medicine to cure some of the common diseases or some substances to
strengthen the immune system.

They are sold by Trade Goods Traders in towns. They can also be found in
[Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink").

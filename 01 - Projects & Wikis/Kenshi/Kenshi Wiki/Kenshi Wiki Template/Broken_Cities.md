Broken Cities could possibly refer to the Reprogramming Workshop to the
north of [Black Desert City](Black_Desert_City.md "wikilink"), which is
filled with "Broken Ones" Skeletons.

However, as of yet there is no concrete information on who, or what the
Broken Cities actually are (though it seems likely to have something to
do with the Skeletons).

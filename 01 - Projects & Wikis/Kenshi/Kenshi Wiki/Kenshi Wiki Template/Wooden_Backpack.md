The **Wooden Backpack** is a piece of starting equipment when beginning
the game as [](Game_Starts.md#The_Freedom_Seekers).

It is one of the few Backpacks which allows stacking of [](Trade_Goods.md). It has a stackable bonus minimum of 3
and mult of 3 allowing items to stack up to 9x inside. (Items which
already stack are stacked up 3x, so things like books will stack up to
12)

**Wend** is a zone which spans part of the length of the eponymous river
and both of its banks. It separates [Rebirth](Rebirth_(Zone).md "wikilink")
in the west from north-eastern Holy Nation territories. It contains
[Drowned Ruins](Drowned_Ruins.md "wikilink") where in one of the
partially-drowned building the legendary [](Armour_King.md) can be found. There are sometimes a few
wandering Skeletons that can be found patrolling this area. Some
mysterious objects can be seen hanging across the mountains in this
area.

The [Lost Library](Lost_Library.md "wikilink") that is located in Wend is
actually impossible to get to from Wend and the player character must
backtrack to [Rebirth](Rebirth_(Zone).md "wikilink") to find the path that
leads to it. There the player will have to get through a horde of [](Blood_Spider.md) before making their way to the locked
library door.

The river **Wend** runs through the entire Holy Nation Territory and is
located east of [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") and south of [](World's_End.md). It is elevated and classified as Arid.

There is a bridge located north of [](Blister_Hill.md) which spans across the river.

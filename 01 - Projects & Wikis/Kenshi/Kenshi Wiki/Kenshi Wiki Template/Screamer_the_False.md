**Screamer The False** is one of the two leaders of the [](Thrall_Masters.md) faction (the other is
[Ponk](Ponk.md "wikilink")). Both are found in the [](Tower_of_Abuse.md). He carries the
[Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") grade [](Heavy_Polearm.md).

Both [Ponk](Ponk.md "wikilink") and Screamer have a bounty of 20,000 cats
and are wanted by the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md).

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If **Screamer the False** and **Ponk** are both killed or imprisoned,
**Thrall Masters** patrols will cease to spawn in
[Venge](Venge.md "wikilink"), [Grey Desert](Grey_Desert.md "wikilink") and
[The Eye](The_Eye.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- "The False" seems to be referring to this Screamer MkI being The False
  version of "General Screamer (The True)" a unique character of the
  MKII Screamer variety listed in the FCS but not actually spawned in
  the game. Similarly General Screamer (The True) would've spawned with
  the exact same armour but at Masterwork Quality, a Meitou grade
  Naginata Katana another polearm weapon, but with combat stats of 80.
- Screamer the False is the only [Screamer MKI](Screamer_MkI.md "wikilink")
  with a bounty, as well as having the lowest stats of any other
  Screamer in Kenshi. (On Average)
- Although Screamer and Ponk lack First Aid Kits in their inventory, if
  you put yourself in a cage on the top floor of their tower they will
  bandage your injuries.

The **South Wetlands** is a swampy area easily recognized by the large
lake in the middle. The most notable aspect of this zone is the [](Slave_Markets.md) located on the eastern side. This area
is also where the HQ of [Swamp Ninjas](Swamp_Ninjas.md "wikilink") can be
found as well as their patrols, often times in skirmish with their rival
[Red Sabres](Red_Sabres.md "wikilink").

## Tips

- Great place to practice [Swimming](Swimming.md "wikilink")!
  - It's advised that you practice swimming in the river going from the
    Wetlands to [Clownsteady](Clownsteady.md "wikilink") instead of inside
    the wetlands, as Blood Spiders are known to traverse the area.
- Swamp Turtles can be found traveling in larger groups here than in The
  Swamp.
- Be careful setting up an outpost here unless you can handle herds of
  swamp raptors going after crops.

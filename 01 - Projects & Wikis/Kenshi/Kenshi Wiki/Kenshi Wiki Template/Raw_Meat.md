**Raw Meat** is an ingredient used primarily in the crafting of
[Food](Food.md "wikilink") at a [Cooking Stove](Cooking_Stove.md "wikilink").
It can be bought from relevant [Traders](Traders.md "wikilink") including
those in [Hive Villages](Hive_Village.md "wikilink") or gathered from most
[Fauna](Fauna.md "wikilink").

It is only edible to [hivers](Hive.md "wikilink"),
[scorchlanders](Human.md "wikilink") and [animals](Fauna.md "wikilink").
Despite its raw status, it retains the same nutritional value as [](Dried_Meat.md). It does not spoil over time.

### Locations

Meat can be gathered from the following creatures.

- [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink"), 5 meat per corpse (not counting
  12 [Foul Raw Meat](Foul_Raw_Meat.md "wikilink")).
- [Bonedogs](Bonedog.md "wikilink"), 3 meat per corpse.
- [Boneyard Wolves](Boneyard_Wolf.md "wikilink"), 3 meat per corpse.
- [Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink"), 6 meat per corpse (not counting 1 [](Foul_Raw_Meat.md)).
- [Garru](Garru.md "wikilink"), 10 meat per corpse.
- [Goats](Goat.md "wikilink"), 7 meat per corpse.
- [Landbats](Landbat.md "wikilink"), 2 meat per corpse (not counting 3
  [Foul Raw Meat](Foul_Raw_Meat.md "wikilink")).
- [Swamp Turtles](Swamp_Turtle.md "wikilink"), 14 meat per corpse.
- [Skimmers](Skimmer.md "wikilink"), 2 meat per corpse (not counting 8
  [Foul Raw Meat](Foul_Raw_Meat.md "wikilink")).
- [Wild Bulls](Wild_Bull.md "wikilink"), 10 meat per corpse.

The safest way to acquire meat is by hunting swamp turtles in the [](South_Wetlands.md), though weaker unit should be
escorted by 30s characters to deal with the other dangers. Swamp turtles
can also be found in [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"). Garrus and Goats
can be found nearly anywhere in the world, but since they do not have
nests, they are hard to track down.

Battle-hardened adventurer groups can also hunt for creatures in the
Bonefields, [Flats Lagoon (Zone)](Flats_Lagoon_(Zone).md "wikilink") or
[High Bonefields](High_Bonefields.md "wikilink"), where many of the more
dangerous animals roam in large packs. Beak things can also be hunted in
many other areas, but requires groups with 40-50 stats to do some until
a decent amounts can be acquired.

If players can ignore potential lore ramifications, raw meat can be
looted in large quantities from [](Cannibal_Village.md), especially [](First_Village.md).

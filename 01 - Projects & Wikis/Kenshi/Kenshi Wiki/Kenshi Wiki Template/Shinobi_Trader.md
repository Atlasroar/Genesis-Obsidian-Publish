**Shinobi Traders**are traders of the [](Shinobi_Thieves.md). They can typically be found in the
[Thieves Guild](Thieves_Guild.md "wikilink") Watchtower. They only sell to
the player when they ally to the Thieves by talking to the [](Thief_Boss.md).

Their vendor inventory typically contains thief or ninja-related items.
They also buy and sell for 50% the price. Because of this, they are a
great source of [Thieves Backpacks](Thieves_Backpack.md "wikilink") and, if
you need them, [](Small_Thieves_Backpack.md).

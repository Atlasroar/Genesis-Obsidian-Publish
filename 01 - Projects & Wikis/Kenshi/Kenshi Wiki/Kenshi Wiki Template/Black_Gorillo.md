## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) Their "weapon" provides them with 5.2 cut
damage and 13 blunt damage which is unaffected by stats. They have 3
attacking animations, 2 of which have 100 power and one which has only
70. To find the damage for the 70 power attack simply multiply the
results for the variants below by 0.7.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.05844149 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.02925) + Strength (0.08775)

<u>**Variant 2**</u>

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.06739199 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.039) + Strength (0.117)

<u>**Variant 3**</u>

**Cut =** 5.2 + 0.07634249 (Martial Arts + Dexterity)

**Blunt =** 13 + Martial Arts (0.04875) + Strength (0.14625)

## Trivia

- Gorillos/Black Gorillos are the only non-robotic animals which do not
  have self healing.
  - The Gorillo animal weapon is the only animal weapon which has no
    pierce damage.
- Due to their high stats and large randomization you could encounter a
  newly spawned Black Gorillo with 65 to 95 defense, which could make
  them an amazing sparring partner.
- All Gorillos have extremely low damage values, even with 100 in all
  stats they will hit a little under 53 (20.468498 cut and 32.5 blunt)
  damage against a target with 50 Toughness with their most powerful
  attacks.

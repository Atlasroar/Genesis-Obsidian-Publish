**Beast Trader** is an [Event](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the player builds an outpost within 11,000 meters of a
[Nomads](Nomads.md "wikilink") owned location. When the conditions have
been fulfilled, the campaign has a 5% chance to trigger each day if
within 6,000 meters of a [Nomads](Nomads.md "wikilink") owned location,
this scales down with distance until it hits 0% chance at 11,000 meters.

Once triggered, the [Nomads](Nomads.md "wikilink") will send a campaign to
the player's base. The campaign will consist of a single squad, made up
of 8-10 [Nomads](Nomad.md "wikilink"), 0-5 [Goats](Goat.md "wikilink"), 0-1
[Wild Bulls](Wild_Bull.md "wikilink"), 1-3 [](Pack_Bull.md), 1 [Bonedog](Bonedog.md "wikilink"), and 1-4
[Pack Beasts](Pack_Beast.md "wikilink"), led by a [](Nomad_Animal_Trader.md).

When the campaign arrives, the leader will request to speak with the
player, offering to sell animals. If spoken to, the player can buy any
animal in the campaign's party. Price for the animals can vary wildly
based on age, skills, and species of the animal. But you can easily
expect them to be several thousand cats for a single animal unless it's
very young.

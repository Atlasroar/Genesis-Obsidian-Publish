The **Tax Collector** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") sent by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) to collect taxes from players that
have agreed to pay taxes in the [](Tax_Man_Visit.md) or **Tax Collector** events, or as a
result of losing the [](Tax_Evasion_Enforcement.md) event. It cannot
trigger if the player is an ally of the
[Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") or [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), an enemy of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), or if [](Emperor_Tengu.md) is killed or captured.

Once triggered, the United Cities will send a campaign to the player's
base. This campaign will consist of 1 squad, made up of 3-6 Samurai and
led by a [Samurai Sergeant](Samurai_Sergeant.md "wikilink"). Once the
campaign arrives, the sergeant will begin shouting at the player to come
speak with them, failing to do so will result in a [](Tax_Evasion_Enforcement.md) event being triggered
in 48-72 hours if this event originally triggered from you agreeing to
pay taxes, or 24-60 hours if this event was a response to failing a
previous [Tax Evasion Enforcement](Tax_Evasion_Enforcement.md "wikilink")
event.

When speaking to the sergeant, they will insult your outpost if it is
less than level 2 (Watchtower icon), then demand you pay 3,000 Cats,
with a chance to increase the taxes to 4,500 Cats if
[Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") is still alive and free. Or, if this event
was triggered in response to failing a Tax Evasion Enforcement event,
you will be demanded to pay 6,000 Cats thanks to a 'late payment' and
'administration fees'.

Agreeing to pay the taxes will result in 140-160 hours, while refusal
will result in a Tax Evasion Enforcement event in 60-72 hours.

Like most tax Events, if the campaign is defeated by a third party
faction like bandits or wild animals on the way to the player's outpost,
it will prevent any future tax visits from the faction until the
player's next import. This is due to the long repeat limit timer, and
the fact that it doesn't consider being defeated by a third party as the
player killing them. This can be exploited by purposefully luring
hostiles to the event's forces while they en route to the player's base.

**Holy Nation Assault (Inquisitor)**, simply referred to as 'Holy Nation
Assault' in-game, is an [event](Events.md "wikilink") that can occur if the
player has defeated the [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Major).md) event. It is closely
related to, but not to be confused with, two other events of the same
name, [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Minor).md), and [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Major).md).

The event cannot trigger if [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) is killed or captured. (Note: The
raid is supposed to be able to trigger with [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) as the leader instead, in
the scenario that Seta has been killed or captured, but the game is not
actually capable of triggering it despite this.)

If all the above requirements are met, [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) will launch an assault on the
player's outpost in 72-200 hours. The assault will generally consist of
two squads, the first made up of 5 [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink") and 3
[Inquisitors](Inquisitor.md "wikilink") led by [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), with the second having 10-12
[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), 1-2 [](High_Paladin.md), and 4-9 [](Holy_Servant.md) led by an
[Inquisitor](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"). Very rarely (roughly 3% chance),
the assault will be accompanied by an additional squad of 10-12
[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), 1-2 [](High_Paladin.md), and 4-9 [](Holy_Servant.md) led by an
[Inquisitor](Inquisitor.md "wikilink").

Once the assault arrives, the War Leader will give a short speech that
changes based on your past interaction with him or the faction as a
whole, then he will order his men to attack the outpost and the player
characters inside it. If the raid is victorious, they will occupy the
player's base, patrolling around it, using the furniture, freeing
captives, and imprisoning your characters. There are no special events
if it is defeated.

The**Broken Ones** are a [Faction](Factions.md "wikilink") of broken
[Soldierbots](Soldierbot.md "wikilink"). They can be found in the
[Reprogramming Workshop](Reprogramming_Workshop.md "wikilink") located in
the north-east section of the [Deadlands](Deadlands.md "wikilink").
Currently, this faction can only be found in this workshop.

Initially, some players may assume these characters to be hostile, since
most [Broken Skeletons](Broken_Skeleton.md "wikilink") are. However, if a
player character enters this workshop, all skeletons will automatically
become allies with that character. This results in the skeletons to have
the 'Following' goal indefinitely for that character.

Since they are allies, the skeletons will attempt to protect the player
character during combat. However, these skeletons fail to differentiate
whether foreign squads are hostile towards the player and will attack
anyone they encounter, including non-player allies and shopkeepers. If
attacked by the player, they will not initiate combat and will attempt
to flee.

Despite having some basic dialogue and the option to chat, the player
cannot interact with this faction and any attempt at communication will
result in an "Error." response.

It is possible for them to be lured out of their building by iron
spiders and other enemies and in this case some of them may die.

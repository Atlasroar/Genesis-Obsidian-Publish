**Stone Rat Assault** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger
if the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has defeated either the [](Stone_Rat_Visit.md) or **Stone Rat Assault** events. It
cannot trigger if the player is allied to the
[Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink") faction, or if [Big Al](Big_Al.md "wikilink")
has been killed or captured.

Once the conditions have been fulfilled, the [](Stone_Rats.md) will send an assault to the player's
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"). This assault has two
variants, depending on the source of the event.

1.  The first variant can trigger if the player has defeated the [](Stone_Rat_Visit.md) event, or sometimes as a
    response to defeating the first variant of the **Stone Rat Assault**
    event. This assault is made up of 2-3 squads, each made up of 5-6
    [Stone Rats](Stone_Rat.md "wikilink"). If the assault is defeated,
    there is a 30% chance to trigger another of the first variant again
    in 48-80 hours, and a 55% chance to trigger the second variant in
    48-80 hours.
2.  The second variant can only trigger as a result of defeating either
    of the variants of the **Stone Rat Assault** event. It consists of
    4-5 squads, each made up of 5-6 [Stone Rats](Stone_Rat.md "wikilink").
    If the assault is defeated, there is a 30% chance to trigger the
    second variant again in 60-100 hours.

If either variant is victorious, they are supposed to ransack the base
for food, breaking into buildings and stealing whatever they come
across. This ransacking behavior is bugged in vanilla though, and will
usually result in NPCs getting caught in a loop running around the base
and standing in doorways. [Stone Rat Visit](Stone_Rat_Visit.md "wikilink")
will also trigger in 90-110 hours.

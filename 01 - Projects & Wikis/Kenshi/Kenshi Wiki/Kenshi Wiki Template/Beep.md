**Beep** is a Hiveless [](Hive_Worker_Drone.md) who can be found in
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"). He is a [](Unique_Recruits.md) and can be recruited at no cost as
he seems to have no understanding of money. He will follow around the
player faction when he sees them until the dialogue is initiated.

He beeps occasionally and has many lines of unique dialogue, proclaiming
himself the "STRONGEST WARRIOR" and "Cyber-beep" after limb
replacements, as well as some extra lines of dialogue with
[Agnu](Agnu.md "wikilink").

Beep has a Brave/Dumb/Honorable [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

## Backstory

Beep was exiled from the [Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") for "being
defective," and ever since then, he has had to run away from enemies.
He's tired of running, and he wants to join your faction.

## Trivia

- Beep can transform into a being known (to himself) as Cyberbeep. When
  he is Cyberbeep, he receives more unique dialogue and will often talk
  to skeletons with dialogue such as "Beep is also a skeleton".
  Humorously, this can be used to interrupt
  [Cat-Lon's](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink") speech, or prevent you from
  trading with a trader if they are a Skeleton until the dialogue
  finishes.
- Beep is featured in a background available for unlocking through
  [Steam Trading Cards](Steam_Trading_Cards.md "wikilink").
- Beep is one of the few characters whose dialogue is written by the
  famous Chris Hunt.
- Beep will almost always beep when waking up, whether from a KO or from
  sleeping to recover wounds, sometimes when fighting he may spam the
  dialogue box with hundreds of Beeps.
- Beep will also beep when reloading saves.
- Beep's name is strange due to the fact that Hivers choose their names
  based on the first thing they see.[^1]
- Beep is the most important character in the game, according to many
  players.
- If you were to dismiss Beep (Provided he is not too powerful to
  recruit after being dismissed) you would be able to speak with him
  again to recruit him again.
- Beep!

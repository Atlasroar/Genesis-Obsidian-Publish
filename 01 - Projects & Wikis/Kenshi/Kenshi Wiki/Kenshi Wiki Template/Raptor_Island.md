Raptor Island is an ancient citadel-turned-nest with a variety of
mid-range [Weapons](Weapons.md "wikilink") and [Armour](Armour.md "wikilink").
Since the nest is partially sunk, speed is severely reduced, but a
sufficiently high athletics character can grab one of the weapons and
escape before the [Megaraptor](Megaraptor.md "wikilink") (whose speed is
unaffected) hits.

It is located in the middle of the eponymously named [](Raptor_Island_(Zone).md) zone.

**Quin** is a member of the [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") faction.
He is located in the [Scraphouse](Scraphouse.md "wikilink"): the big
ancient factory next to [](Black_Desert_City.md). He has a lot of highly valuable
goods for sale such as hard to get [Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink"),
high quality [Weapons](Weapons.md "wikilink"), high quality
[crossbows](Crossbow_(Class).md "wikilink"), [](Ancient_Science_Book.md) and the rare [](AI%20Core.md) (which do not respawn).

When Quin interacts with a [Hiver](Hive.md "wikilink") he will say his
usual line, but with a twist: "Welcome, dear huma-uh... welcome dear.
Please excuse the mess. Anything shiny, Dack hoards. A simpleton really.
I'm sure his mind was fried when he got hit on the head back in the cha-
uh... back some time ago...".

When Quin interacts with a [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") he will also
say his usual line but refer back to the collapse of the First Empire:
"Welcome, and please excuse the mess. Anything shiny, Dack hoards. A
simpleton, really. I'm sure his mind was fried when he got hit on the
head back during the chaos age. Trying times I'm sure you remember..."

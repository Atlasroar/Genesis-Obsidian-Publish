**Slavemongers** are foot-soldiers of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md), tasked with finding new slaves. They
can be found roaming the [Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink") and many
other places. If Slavemongers encounter unconscious characters, they
will enslave them.

Slavemongers will steal weapons from unconscious characters, including
ones from the player's squad.

They are similar to [Manhunters](Manhunter.md "wikilink") and [](Slave_Hunter.md), but rather than being middlemen, they
are directly employed by the Slavers Guild. Unlike Manhunters and Slave
Hunters, Slavemongers won't engage in opportunistic attacks on players
to sell them into slavery. They will, however, still enslave them if
they are knocked unconscious by a third party.

## Trivia

- It appears that if you follow Slavemongers long enough, they will end
  up selling their slaves at [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") if it is
  under HN control.
- If certain town NPCs are knocked down and slavemongers pass by, they
  will enslave them and may result in conflict with the town guards.

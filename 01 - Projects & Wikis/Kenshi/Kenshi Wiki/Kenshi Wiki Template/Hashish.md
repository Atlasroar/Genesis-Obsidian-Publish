**Hashish** (also known as **Hash**) is a [](Trade_Goods.md) and a generally illegal drug made from
[Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink"). Hashish is illegal in most places throughout
the world, leading to a hugely profitable markup outside of where its
produced, but comparatively very few buyers available.

Players can also produce hashish themselves by researching [](Hashish_Production_(Tech).md) and building a [](Hemp_Processor.md). These structures are illegal and
may attract unwanted attention from nearby factions which outlaw it. A
hefty flow of [Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink") is required to mass produce
hashish.

Important to note that when selling to the Shinobi Thieves that they
purchase stuff at half price. Meaning that a 500% (+400%) multiplier
becomes a 250% (+150%).

Additionally, [Manhunter
Base](Manhunter_Base/Mercenary_Guild "wikilink") (Under Mercenary guild
control) [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink") and [](Flats_Lagoon.md) will buy it with 400% Markup. Since any
trader in these locations will buy Hashish, selling here is not subject
to the Shinobi Thieves’ 50% purchase price cut. This makes these
locations the second most profitable to sell at.

### Locations

Hashish can be purchased in [Hive Villages](Hive_Village.md "wikilink") and
in [The Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"). [Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink"), the main
ingredient of Hashish, can be purchased throughout the world (with a
notable exception being the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink")),
but large quantities are necessary for the production of Hashish (Thus,
farming it yourself is recommended).

### Tips

- The best place to sell Hashish is in Trader's Edge if controlled by
  the Anti-Slavers. The Weapon and Ranger shop will purchase it at 1200%
  Markup. This requires killing Tengu, as well as Longen with Tinfist
  still alive.
- The next best places to sell would be any Shinobi tower in the United
  Cities (Great Desert/Heng areas), though selling there means just a
  600% markup (1200%\*50%)
- Large quantities can be found in the [](Secret_Drug_Farm.md) and sold nearby in [](Flats_Lagoon.md).
- Flats Lagoon is near The Swamp and will buy Hashish for a sizable
  markup.
- Hashish can NOT be sold to a Thief fence in bars, only the Shinobi
  Trader in Shinobi towers will purchase it.
- Hashish can be sold in Shop Counters however they will only sell for
  the Avg. Price instead of the Mark-up price.

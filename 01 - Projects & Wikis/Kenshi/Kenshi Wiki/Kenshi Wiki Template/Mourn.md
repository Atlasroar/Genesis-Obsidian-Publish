**Mourn** is a [Major Town](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") located in the
[Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink") between [Catun](Catun.md "wikilink")
and [Flats Lagoon](Flats_Lagoon.md "wikilink"). Mourn is built inside of an
ancient metal structure, looming over the north and south sides of the
town. A slave rebellion left this once thriving mining town in shambles.
There are no guards at the gates, and most buildings are ruined. Also,
although there are several [Harpoon Turrets](Harpoon_Turret.md "wikilink")
on the walls, due to the fact Mourn has no energy-producing structures
whatsoever, they are useless. It is still marked by the
**[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the United Cities (Extended Territories)**
as part of the [Empire](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") despite being
independent.

Mourn is home to the [](Great_White_Gorillo.md) which is locked in the
Abandoned HQ building. When entering the bar, the bartender will warn
you to keep the gate locked, and not to enter.

The infamous [Blue Eyes](Blue_Eyes.md "wikilink") can be found in the bar.
Mourn can also be home to some recruits, specifically
[Hobbs](Hobbs.md "wikilink").

Mourn is probably the most dangerous non-hostile town in all of Kenshi.
If measures to help the town are not taken, the place will be overrun
and slaughtered by the sheer savagery of the wildlife that lurks outside
its walls, including the dreaded [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink").
Even then, it's likely Mourn's walls will be filled with piles of dead
bodies on a constant basis.

Mourn's lack of town guards makes it susceptible to all the potential
spawns in the [Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink"). These dangers can be
[Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink"), [Bonedogs](Bonedog.md "wikilink"),
[Boneyard Wolves](Boneyard_Wolf.md "wikilink"), and [](Skin_Spider.md). Patrols of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md) and [](The_Gorrillo_Bandits.md) are also possible. It is
unlikely that a [Leviathan](Leviathan.md "wikilink") will attempt to enter
the town, but one could potentially be lured there.

There are many camp beds scattered inside the walls of this town.
Players can use them at no cost. Players should remain focused on
resting characters, however, because characters might not wake up to
protect themselves from being eaten alive by Beak Things.

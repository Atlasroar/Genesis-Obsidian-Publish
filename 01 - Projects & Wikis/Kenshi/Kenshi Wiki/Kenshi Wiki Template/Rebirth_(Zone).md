## Tips

- The Flotsam Safehouse provides many useful supplies, there are no
  repercussions from taking them.
- If you are a non human, avoid this area, unless you wish to be
  enslaved.
- In the event you escape the Rebirth camp, head north to the Flotsam
  Safehouse. It is full of food, hacksaws to break shackles, and clothes
  to disguise yourself.

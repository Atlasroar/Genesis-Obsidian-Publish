**Free Settlement** is a small deserted town located south of
[Brink](Brink.md "wikilink"). It belongs to the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) but there are no residents nor roaming
guards. There are a couple of ruined buildings and several of them have
[Building Materials](Building_Materials.md "wikilink"), [](Iron_Plates.md), [Fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink") and some less
useful items.

It is unclear what exactly is the cause of this town's devastation, but
given the location where it is built, it was probably abandoned due to
the hostile fauna or [Anti-Slavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") in the
region.

**Flats Lagoon** is a [Major Town](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") controlled by
the [Tech Hunters](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink") and therefore has been added
to the **Tech Hunters [Map](Maps.md "wikilink")**.
![](FlatsLagoon2.jpg "FlatsLagoon2.jpg")The town's bartender can be
asked about the [Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink"), though most of the
information relayed more specifically relates to adjacent areas which
players must travel through to reach the Ashlands.

As with all Tech Hunters locations, there are no [](World_States.md) which can affect Flats Lagoon.

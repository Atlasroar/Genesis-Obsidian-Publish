**Display Stand** is a [building](Buildings_List.md "wikilink"). Players
can construct it after learning a [blueprint](Blueprints.md "wikilink").
This building can be found in the 'Interior' category of the Build Menu.
If things are dropped near it, they might land on this small shelf.
Despite being a "display" stand, it will not display any of items
dropped into its inventory to be actually seen in game. The stand,
however, can be used and accessed as any other storage and has
dimensions of 4x4.

This building is commonly used as visual storage for items in [shops and
other buildings in town](:Category:Town_Residents "wikilink"). It can
also be found in [Lost Libraries](Lost_Library.md "wikilink").

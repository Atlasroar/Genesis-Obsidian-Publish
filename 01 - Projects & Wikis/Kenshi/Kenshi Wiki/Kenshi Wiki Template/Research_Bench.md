A **Research Bench** is a work station where a
[Science](Science.md "wikilink") oriented party member can study new
[technologies](Technology.md "wikilink"). At each increase in [](Tech_Level_(Tech).md) players gain access to a new level
of research bench capable of researching higher technologies.

Any bench starting at level 2 and above can be upgraded to the next
level by clicking and hitting upgrade button. There is no need to remove
the old bench and build from scratch. Researching from multiple benches
is possible and gives diminishing returns on the speed of research with
every new bench used in the process.

## Upgrades

| Building Level     | Material Cost                            | Power Consumption | Efficiency |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------|
| Research Bench II  | 10x [Iron Plate](Iron_Plate.md "wikilink")  | 0                 | 90%        |
| Research Bench III | 20 x [Iron Plate](Iron_Plate.md "wikilink") | 10                | 95%        |
| Research Bench IV  | 25 x [Iron Plate](Iron_Plate.md "wikilink") | 15                | 100%       |
| Research Bench V   | 30 x [Iron Plate](Iron_Plate.md "wikilink") | 25                | 105%       |
| Research Bench VI  | 35 x [Iron Plate](Iron_Plate.md "wikilink") | 30                | 110%       |

**Bounty Hunters** are members of the [](Bounty_Hunters.md) faction. Some can be found in a
Bounty Hunter Camp in [Watcher's Rim](Watcher's_Rim.md "wikilink") hunting
the [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"). Most of these roam around [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) territories between towns, while some
head out into [Stobe's Gamble](Stobe's_Gamble.md "wikilink") or [](Stobe's_Garden.md), possibly looking for the
[Anti-Slavers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") and their bounties.

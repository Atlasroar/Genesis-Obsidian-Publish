**Red Sabre Raid** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 4,200 meters of
the [Red Sabre Hideout](Red_Sabre_Hideout.md "wikilink"). It has a 40% to
trigger each day if within 3,700 meters, this chance scales down with
distance until it hits 0% at 4,200 meters. It cannot trigger if the [](Red_Sabre_Boss.md) has been killed or captured.

Once the conditions have been fulfilled, the [](Red_Sabres.md) will send an assault to the player's
base. This assault will consist of 2 squads, each made up of 7-11 [](Red_Sabre.md).

assault arrives, the War Leader will give a short speech, before
ordering the assault to begin, breaking down gates, attacking
characters, and liberating captives.

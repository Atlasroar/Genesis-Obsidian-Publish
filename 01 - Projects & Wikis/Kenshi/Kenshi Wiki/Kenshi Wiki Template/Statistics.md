**Character Statistics** (henceforth abbreviated as **stats**) are a
collection of numbers that define your character, modifying what your
character can do and how effectively they can do it. These stats can be
increased by completing actions that are affected by said stats. For
example, weapons skills can be increased by engaging in combat with the
specified weapon.

Statistics break down into seven main categories: Attributes, Weapon
Skills, Combat Skills, Thievery Skills, Athletic Skills, Science Skills,
and Trade Skills.

In the Stats window, players can view all the levels of their selected
Player Character. By hovering over a specific skill, players can read
descriptions about that skill as well as view how much experience their
character has towards the next level in that skill.

  resistance, wound deterioration speed, martial arts damage, and chance
  to (Used for NPCs resisting Assassination attempts) resist stealth
  knock-outs. Also lowers the knock-out point (the level at which they

  (how long they stay unconscious when knocked-out), and raises the
  amount of damage required to cause them to (Different than stagger
  which happens on any hit) stumble. (Stumble/stagger does not work on

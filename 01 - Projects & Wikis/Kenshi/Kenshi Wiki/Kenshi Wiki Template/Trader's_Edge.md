**Trader's Edge** is a settlement in [Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"),
territory of the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"). Although
it's run by [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink"), the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) protects its entrance. It is located
on a plateau next to the city [Heng](Heng.md "wikilink") and connected by a
metal bridge.

HQ. Inside the HQ is their leader [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink"), as well
as a potential recruit [Yamdu](Yamdu.md "wikilink").

The economy of this town relies on supplies from [](Stone_Camp.md), [](South_Stone_Camp.md) and
[Eyesocket](Eyesocket.md "wikilink"), the same as Heng.

The player can often time encounter [Harmothoe](Harmothoe.md "wikilink")'s

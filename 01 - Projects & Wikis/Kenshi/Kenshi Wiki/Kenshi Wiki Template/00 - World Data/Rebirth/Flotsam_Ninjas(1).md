If [Holy Lord Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink"), [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), and [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) are all [](World_States.md), [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") is
[overtaken](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md).

Most of the areas are barren after the takeover, mainly with the obvious
change being the absence of the giant statue. It is mostly patrolled by
Flotsam Ninjas with no signs of servants, assumingly have escaped within
the midst of chaos following the death of the above important
individuals.

## Trivia

- This override will change the Rebirth icon on the map from a "labour
  camp" (pickaxe and shovel) to one similar to an "Outpost"
  (cross-swords with a banner).

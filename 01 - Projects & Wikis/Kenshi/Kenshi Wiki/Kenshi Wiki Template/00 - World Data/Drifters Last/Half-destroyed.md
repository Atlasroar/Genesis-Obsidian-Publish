[Drifter's Last](Drifter's_Last.md "wikilink") was a [](Major_Towns.md) controlled by the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) faction. It became half destroyed when
[Lady Merin](Lady_Merin.md "wikilink"), its former governor, was killed,
but [Slave Mistress Grace](Slave_Mistress_Grace.md "wikilink") of the
nearby [Slave Farm South](Slave_Farm_South.md "wikilink") remained alive.
As a consequence Drifter's Last went into a decline, while still under
control of the United Cities.

It has an [](Empire_Southwest_Trade_Culture.md)**.**

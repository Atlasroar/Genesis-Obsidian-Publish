If [Holy Lord Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink") and [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) are [](World_States.md) while [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) is alive and free, [](Holy_Mines.md) will be [](Town_Overrides.md) by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

This location functions more similar to a food storage than a mine, as
indicated by the amount of food these buildings possess and the fact

defeating The Holy Nation.

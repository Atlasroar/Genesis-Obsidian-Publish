If [Esata the Stone Golem](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") and the
three Holy Nation leaders are dead, the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) should take over [](Blister_Hill.md). However, due to the fact how priorities
are set up, the player can never achieve this override because they'll
either get [Flotsam Ninjas](Blister_Hill/Flotsam_Ninjas "wikilink") or
[Holy Nation Outlaws](Blister_Hill/Holy_Nation_Outlaws "wikilink")
takeover versions of Blister Hill override.

## Trivia

Curiously, unlike most other United Cities overrides in [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) territory, this override does not
account for [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink") and
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink"). This may be of a result of this override
being setup incompletely and incorrectly, which is likely to be the
case, given the fact that this override is never capable of being
achieved during normal gameplay means.

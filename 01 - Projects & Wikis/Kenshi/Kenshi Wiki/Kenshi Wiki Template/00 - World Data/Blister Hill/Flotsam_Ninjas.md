**Blister Hill, Flotsam Ninjas** is a large town located towards the
north of [Okran's Pride](Okran's_Pride.md "wikilink") controlled by
[Flotsam Ninjas](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/00%20-%20World%20Data/Blister%20Hill/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink"). It belonged to [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) until [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) and [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) were kidnapped or killed
while [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") stayed alive and free.

Be aware that Flotsam Ninjas don't have any trade culture making
[Bloodrum](Bloodrum.md "wikilink") still purchasable from barmans.

The city is also under a permanent blackout because Flotsam Ninjas took
out all of the power supply when they took control of this city. Players
must build their own windmills/generators in order to light up Blister
Hill once again. Ironically this override is called "Prosperous" in the
FCS.

If [Slave Master Wada](Slave_Master_Wada.md "wikilink") along with either
of [Slave Master Ruben](Slave_Master_Ruben.md "wikilink"),
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") or [](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md) are [](World_States.md), [Heft](Heft.md "wikilink") will
become malnourished.

Technically, there are three different **Malnourished**
[overrides](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") for Heft â€” depending on which
specific character is killed or imprisoned along with Wada. In practice,
though, every single one of these overrides produce the same result.

The **Manhunter Base, Mercenary Guild** is an outpost controlled by the
[Mercenary Guild](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Manhunter%20Base/Mercenary_Guild.md "wikilink"). It belonged to
[Manhunters](Manhunters.md "wikilink") until [](Slave_Market_Master.md) and [](Slave_Mistress_Grace.md) were both killed.

Although the [](Empire_Southwest_Trade_Culture.md) disappeared from
this location when the override occurred it still retains it, meaning
you can sell stuff like Hashish at for the increased price.

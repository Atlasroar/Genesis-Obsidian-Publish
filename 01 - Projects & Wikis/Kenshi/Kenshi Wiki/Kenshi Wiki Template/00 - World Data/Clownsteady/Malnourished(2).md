Killing or capturing the [](Slave_Market_Master.md) at the nearby [](Slave_Markets.md) will cripple
[Clownsteady](Clownsteady.md "wikilink")'s economy, destroying half of the
buildings and making the inhabitants starve. The same will happen if
[Slave Mistress Grace](Slave_Mistress_Grace.md "wikilink") is also killed
or kidnapped.

If both Slave Masters are killed, this town will switch its override.

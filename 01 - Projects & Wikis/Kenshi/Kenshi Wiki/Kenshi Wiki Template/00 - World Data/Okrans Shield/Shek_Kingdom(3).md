If [High Inquisitor Valtena](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md "wikilink") is
[killed or imprisoned](World_States.md "wikilink") while [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) is alive, [](Okran's_Shield.md) will [](Town_Overrides.md) of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) â€“ but only if the player is allied
with that faction.

## Trivia

- Despite lacking traversing routes to take over Okran's Shield, this
  override can still happen even if both
  [Seta](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md "wikilink") and
  [Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink") are alive, which prevents Shek
  Kingdom to attack through southern HN territory.

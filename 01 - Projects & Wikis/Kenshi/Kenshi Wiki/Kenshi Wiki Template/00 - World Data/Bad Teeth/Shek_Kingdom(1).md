**Bad teeth, Shek Kingdom** is a city controlled by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md). It belonged to [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) until [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) was kidnapped or killed, while
[Esata the Stone Golem](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") remained alive
and free. The town itself is guarding a mountain pass between the
fertile valley of [Okran's Pride](Okran's_Pride.md "wikilink") and hostile
wilderness of the [Skinner's Roam](Skinner's_Roam.md "wikilink").

It belonged to [The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") until [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) and [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) were kidnapped or killed while
[Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink") and
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") were alive and free. It could have also
belonged to the [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink"), a previous
override, until High Inquisitor Valtena and Esata the Stone Golem were
kidnapped or killed while Emperor Tengu and Longen were alive and free.

The town itself is guarding a mountain pass between the fertile valley
of [Okran's Pride](Okran's_Pride.md "wikilink") and hostile wilderness of
the [Skinner's Roam](Skinner's_Roam.md "wikilink").

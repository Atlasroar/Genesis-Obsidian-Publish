If the [Holy Lord Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink") has been
killed/kidnapped but [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) has not been, [](Bad_Teeth.md) will become half-destroyed. Although it's
actual appearance will look more as less prosperous rather than
half-destroyed as most buildings aren't ruined, but there are lesser
amount of shops, mostly replaced by residential buildings.

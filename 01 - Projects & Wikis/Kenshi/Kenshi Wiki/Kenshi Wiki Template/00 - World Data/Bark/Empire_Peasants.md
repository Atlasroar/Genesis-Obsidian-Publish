[Bark](Bark.md "wikilink") is taken over by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/00%20-%20World%20Data/Bark/Empire_Peasants.md) if either:

- [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink") and [](Lady_Sanda.md) are both killed.
- [Slave Master Wada](Slave_Master_Wada.md "wikilink"), Lady Sanda and
  [Lady Kana](Lady_Kana.md "wikilink") are killed.

In [FCS](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md "wikilink") there is two kinds of
prosperous Bark, however it's the same Bark only the conditions to reach
the world states are different. However there is still a slight
difference since more [Generic Recruits](Generic_Recruits.md "wikilink")
could be found if the override occurs with the Tengu's death.

[Izumi](Izumi.md "wikilink") and [Jewel](Jewel.md "wikilink") still hang in
bars and [Hobbs](Hobbs.md "wikilink") may hang there too.

Empire Peasants run some shops along [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Free_Traders.md) and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md) protect the town.
[Anti-Slavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") are settled in the noble house
if [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") is alive and free.

[Empire Trade Culture](Empire_Trade_Culture.md "wikilink") still applies
here since Empire Peasants and United Cities share the same trade
culture.

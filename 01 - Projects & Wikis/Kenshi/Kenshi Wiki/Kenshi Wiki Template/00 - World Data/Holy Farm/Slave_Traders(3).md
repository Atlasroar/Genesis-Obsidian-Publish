Holy Farms will only be [overridden](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink") and
captured by the [Slave Traders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink"), functionally
turning it into a slave farm, if [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md),
[Esata](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink"), and either [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) or [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) have been killed/kidnapped, as
long as [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink") and
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") are still alive and free.

Due to being incorrectly assigned the overrides of the [](Holy_Mines.md), it might flip to [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md), [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md), or a destroyed version shortly after
going to the [Slave Traders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink"), if the
appropriate conditions are fulfilled. Possibly preventing the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) override from ever appearing for the
player.

There are dialog changes to farmers if the
[Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink") is dead, and
[Esata](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") is alive and free, though this
is not an override, and the farms will remain in [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) control.

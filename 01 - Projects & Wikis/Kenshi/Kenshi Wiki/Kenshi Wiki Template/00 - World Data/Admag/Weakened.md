If [Seto](Seto.md "wikilink") is killed, [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink") will
have a notable lack of military population to reflect the increased
[Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink")'s patrols around [](Okran's_Gulf.md) and [](Okran's_Pride.md).

**Note**: The overall town population may instead increase, contrary to
the lore.

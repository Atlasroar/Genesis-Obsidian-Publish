## Trivia

- Despite listed as "Prosperous" in the FCS. This town appears to have a
  generally lower quality of living than when UC were in control. Which
  might mean that the "Prosperous" is called so because it has more
  prosperity than other Town Overrides of this town, rather than being
  more thriving originally.

**Sho-Battai** will become Half-Destroyed if [](Lord_Nagata.md) is killed/imprisoned while [](Emperor_Tengu.md) is alive and free.

If [Lady Kana](Lady_Kana.md "wikilink") is killed/imprisoned as well, it
will trigger the Half-Destroyed and malnourished version instead,
causing squads of [Peasant Farmers](Peasant_Farmer.md "wikilink") to spawn
and fight with the [Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink"), both of whom are
malnourished.

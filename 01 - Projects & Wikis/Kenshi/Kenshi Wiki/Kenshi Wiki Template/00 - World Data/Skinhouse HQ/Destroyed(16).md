If [Savant](Savant.md "wikilink") is [](World_States.md), the [](Skinhouse_HQ.md) falls into
[ruins](Town_Overrides.md "wikilink"). Any valuable loot left behind will
then be removed.

## Trivia

- The "destroyed" overrides of [Skinhouses](Skinhouse.md "wikilink") and
  the [Skinhouse HQ](Skinhouse_HQ.md "wikilink") are the only
  [FCS](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md "wikilink") items of type "Town" in
  use which are not assigned to any faction. In practice, though, the
  game treats them as if they still belonged to the [](Skin_Bandits.md).

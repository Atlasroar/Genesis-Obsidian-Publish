If Tengu and Inaba are both dead/imprisoned and if
[Yabuta](Yabuta_of_the_Sands.md "wikilink") wasn't freed from [](Tengu's_Vault.md) (or died after), Stoat is taken over by
[Tech Hunters](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Stoat/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink"). Stoat will remain in a
half-destroyed state and without gate guards.

Oddly, the [Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink") pacifier still can
be found in the bar as well [Hobbs](Hobbs.md "wikilink").

Due to a lack of security it's easy for [Skimmers](Skimmer.md "wikilink")
and [Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") to quickly run in the center of
the town and start butchering everyone. Plus, [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md) and Tech Hunters aren't allies so
they won't take care of each other making survival for them more
difficult.

You should be aware that Tech Hunters rules imply the town is running by
[Empire Lawless Trade Culture](Empire_Lawless_Trade_Culture.md "wikilink")
and no longer by [](Empire_Trade_Culture.md). Slavery is now a crime which
eventually leads to fights against [Manhunters](Manhunters.md "wikilink")
or [Slave Hunters](Slave_Hunters.md "wikilink") if they are still wandering
from town to town in this zone.

If Tengu and Inaba are both dead/imprisoned and if
[Yabuta](Yabuta_of_the_Sands.md "wikilink") escaped from [](Tengu's_Vault.md) while still being alive, Yabuta's
outlaw will overrun the city with his cronies and set it up as his base
of operations.

It's difficult for Yabuta Outlaws to survive because they have to deal
with [Bounty Hunters](Bounty_Hunters.md "wikilink"), [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md) and others factions depending on
certain [World States](World_States.md "wikilink") like
[Manhunters](Manhunters.md "wikilink") and [](Slave_Hunters.md).

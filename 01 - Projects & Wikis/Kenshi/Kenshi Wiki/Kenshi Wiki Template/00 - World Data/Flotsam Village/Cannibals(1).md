If [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") is dead or imprisoned **Flotsam Village**
will be overrun by [Cannibals](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink"). [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) will still appear as part of the
"Residence" list despite no longer present. Most of the buildings will
be destroyed.

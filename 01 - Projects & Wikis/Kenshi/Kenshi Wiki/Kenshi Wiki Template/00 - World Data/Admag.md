**Admag** is the capital of the [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink").
This [Major Town](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") is placed on top of a hill and
only has one entrance. It is located in [](Stenn_Desert.md). Its location can be revealed by
reading the **[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the Shek Kingdom**.

The powerful [Hundred Guardians](Hundred_Guardian.md "wikilink") are the
town's main defense, although [Shek Warriors](Shek_Warrior.md "wikilink")
patrol the desert.

This is the home of the Shek Kingdom's leader: [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md). She resides in the Faction HQ
building. Esata is accompanied by [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink") and
[Seto](Seto.md "wikilink"). The building is also guarded by the kingdom's
toughest warriors: [](The_Five_Invincibles.md).

There is also a chance for a player to encounter some [](Unique_Recruits.md) inside the bar here such as
[Oron](Oron.md "wikilink"), [Ruka](Ruka.md "wikilink"), [](Rane_the_Giant.md) and [Kang](Kang.md "wikilink").
[Seto](Seto.md "wikilink") can also be recruited here after a player
distinguishes themselves in the eyes of the Shek Kingdom.

If the [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") has control over
[Stack](Stack.md "wikilink"), the Faction HQ may relocate there.

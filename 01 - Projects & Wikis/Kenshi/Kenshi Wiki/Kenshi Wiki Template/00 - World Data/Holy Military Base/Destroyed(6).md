If the [Holy Lord Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink") is [](World_States.md), at least one of the Holy Military
Bases should fall into ruins. However, due the way how the [](Town_Overrides.md) mechanic works, this override will
always have a lower priority than [Holy Military
Base/Fogmen](Holy_Military_Base/Fogmen "wikilink") â€” meaning that,
without mods, the player will never see this override in their game.

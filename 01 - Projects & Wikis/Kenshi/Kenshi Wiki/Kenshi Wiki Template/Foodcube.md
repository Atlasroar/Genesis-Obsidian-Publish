A**Foodcube** is a [Food](Food.md "wikilink") item, purchased from relevant
[Traders](Traders.md "wikilink") or created in a [](Cooking_Stove.md). They make good travelling rations and
can very easy to mass produce. Making Foodcubes for profit is not
recommended however as they sell for half of their value. Foodcubes have
the same nutritional value as [Gohan](Gohan.md "wikilink"), but are much
more expensive.

Foodcubes are essentially a nutritious block made from a vegetable-grain
mixture. It is similar in concept and appearance to the real-world
[nutraloaf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutraloaf).

Foodcubes are listed as an ingredient for [](Ration_Pack.md), however they are not actually craftable.

After selecting a [Game Start](Game_Starts.md "wikilink"), players are
brought to the **Character Customization** screen. Depending on their
game start, there may be restrictions on what [Races](Races.md "wikilink")
their characters can be. Some game starts have multiple characters to
customize, while many only begin with a single character.

Players can reenter the **Character Customization** screen later in game
through dialogue. After hiring a [](Generic_Recruits.md), players will be given a chance to
customize that character. Players can also speak to a [](Plastic_Surgeon.md) and open character customization
for their currently selected character for a small fee. During this
time, players will not be able to change the race of the character they
are customizing.

### Hair Customization

and beards on [Human](Human.md "wikilink") characters. Beards are only
available for male characters, but all non-beard hairstyles are
available to male and female genders. Players can also change the hue,
saturation, and brightness for the character's hair color.

Currently there are X main features available, which are: being male or
female, Race, subrace, several Face types and 40 Hair types. Skin tones

head size, and shape independently. And for female characters you can
also adjust breast size, perkiness, and shape. As for lower body
modifications you can adjust overall height, posture which ranges from
hunchback to English gentleman, frame bulk (Fat/Musculature), leg length
and shape, hip size, feet size, waist size, stomach bulk, and mid
section girth.

## Followers

A hired sword for hire can be customized in the same way as your
character, including their name. The same customisation screen as for
the beginning character appears after hiring them. Though, players
cannot change sword for hire's genders or races.

The **Animal Feeder** can store [Food](Food.md "wikilink") items so if
[animal](Fauna.md "wikilink") player characters are nearby they can get
their [Food](Food.md "wikilink") automatically. Non-animal player
characters will also eat from the Animal Feeder if it is nearby. This
building has an **18x18** size inventory.

This building also has the same function as a [](Food_Store.md). It will be used to store food if it is
closer than a proper Food Store. This building is, however, less
efficient as a [Storage](Storage.md "wikilink") building than the proper
Food Store because it does not stack identical food items.

**Yabuta of the Sands** is a prisoner in [](Tengu's_Vault.md). Releasing him and letting him live
will cause the creation of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Yabuta_Outlaws.md).

Yabuta has a Crazy [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If **Yabuta of the Sands** is freed from Tengu's Vault and successfully
escaped, several World States will trigger.

His release will cause [Yabuta Outlaws](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Yabuta_Outlaws.md "wikilink")
faction to start existing.

[Fort Simion](Fort_Simion.md "wikilink") will be turned into [](Fort_Yabuta.md) if it is still under [](Rebel_Farmers.md) and the player is not allied with
**Rebel Farmers.**

[Stoat](Stoat.md "wikilink") will also fall under **Yabuta Outlaws**
control if it is under the control of [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md).

[Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") patrols in [](The_Great_Desert.md) will cease to spawn after him being
freed if the conditions for them to spawn there are already achieved
beforehand.

His release will also cause Rebel Farmers patrols in
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink") to become less frequent.

**Yabuta Outlaws** will start patrolling in
[Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink"), [Grey Desert](Grey_Desert.md "wikilink"),
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"), [Sinkuun](Sinkuun.md "wikilink"),
[Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink"), [](The_Great_Desert.md), and [](The_Hook.md).

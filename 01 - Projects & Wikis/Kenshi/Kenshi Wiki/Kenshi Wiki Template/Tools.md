**Tools** are an [item](Items.md "wikilink") that can be bought and sold to
make a very small profit. They are sold by [](Trade_Goods_Trader.md).  

They can also be used in the construction of [](Thief_Training_Boxes.md) and to open locked containers
without requiring the [Lockpicking](Lockpicking.md "wikilink") skill. 

The higher your strength level the faster they work.

## Trivia

- If you wait until the Tools almost break a lock and then cancel your
  action (R), you can then choose to break the lock using Strength so
  that the Tools are not consumed (as it weakens the lock STR wise).
- Multiple characters can use Tools at the same time to speed up the
  process.
- Tools and Hacksaw work identically to each other.
- Tools are required to be in your inventory to be used. Attempting to
  use one from inside a bag will not work.

![](Deadhive-Worker.png "Deadhive-Worker.png") **Deadhive Worker** is a
[Race](Races.md "wikilink") in Kenshi. Deadhive Worker is a subrace of
[Hive](Hive.md "wikilink"). This race is used exclusively for
[Fogman](Fogman.md "wikilink") characters.

Compared to the [](Hive_Worker_Drone.md), the Deadhive Worker is
significantly feeble in all of their body parts. They also bleed slower
with a rate of 0.2 instead of 0.3, as well as having twice as much
vision and hunger rate of 1 instead of 0.5 and a slightly slower minimum
running speed of 16 mph instead of 18 mph.

When comparing experience multipliers, the Deadhive Worker lacks the
[Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink") experience boost (same as the
[Southern Hive-equvalent](Southern_Hive_Worker_Drone.md "wikilink")) but
does not have the penalties of [Cooking](Cooking.md "wikilink") and
[Science](Science.md "wikilink").

**Edgewalkers** was an ancient weapon manufacturer.

## Overview

They were one of the highest-grade manufacturer of weapons and despite
being ancient, their weapons are stronger and more expensive than nearly
any other manufacturer.

These weapons are possessed by some of the strongest (or richest)
characters in the game, and can be found as

Edge Type 2+ you must purchase/steal them from the

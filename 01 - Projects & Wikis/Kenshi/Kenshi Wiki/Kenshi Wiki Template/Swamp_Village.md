**Swamp Villages** are two small villages which contain a few buildings
and resources within [the Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink"). Both can be
discovered by reading the **[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") of the Swamps**. Both
have Big Shops and [Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink") dealers.
[Swampers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Swampers.md "wikilink") run and protect both villages so they
serve as helpful rest stops in [the Swamp](The_Swamp.md "wikilink") for
players to heal in relative safety.

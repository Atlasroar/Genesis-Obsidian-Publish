**Southern Hive Villages** serve as settlements for the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md), holding a large amount of [](Southern_Hive_Worker_Drone.md) who will mine and
farm during the day and sleep during the night. These villages have a
few [droneguards](Droneguard.md "wikilink") defending them and patrols will
run through them occasionally. They are dangerous due to the sheer
number of hivers and the decently powerful hive soldiers who defend
them.

Southern Hive villages can have a fair amount of loot in their huts
offering basic [building materials](Building_Materials.md "wikilink"), some
[Food](Food.md "wikilink") (dried fish, rice bowls, dried meat, etc.),
Catun level weapons, [Cats](Cats.md "wikilink"), standard quality Armour,
and 'household' items like bowls. There are usually four huts in these
villages.

Just like with the [Western Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink"), when the
Queen of the South dies, both villages will become [](Deadhive_Overrun.md).

**Rebel Farmers**are rebelling peasants and escaped slaves from the
[United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") who are angry about the
brutality of the upper classes, or simply resorting to banditry to feed
themselves. They can often be found hanging around empire lands,
attacking slavers and other travelers on the roads and then retreating
back to their camps.

Although their cause is just (given that they just want to be treated
fairly and punish the ruthless [nobility](Noble_Circle.md "wikilink")),
many citizens and peasants of the empire have a hard time sympathizing
with the Rebels, given that their banditry isn't exclusive to the upper
class. Even the civilian AI reflects this lore, as depending on the
civilian NPC, they either flee during the conflict or assist Empire
Samurai in fighting the rebels (although the only civilian units that
really fight the bandits are caravan or shop guards).

If the United Cities gets destabilized and weakened as a result of the
death of certain nobles, they will increase in number or get replaced by
the higher quality [Rebel Swordsmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md "wikilink").

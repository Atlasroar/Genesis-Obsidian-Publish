**Large Backpack** is an unwieldy [backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") that
will hamper your fighting ability. Of all backpacks available to
humanoids, it has the largest grid, which is **12x20**. Only the [](Garru_Backpack.md) and [](Bull_Backpack.md) are larger and being able to stack
[Trade Goods](Trade_Goods.md "wikilink"), which this bag can't. Due to this
bag being tied with [](Traders_Backpack_Large.md) as the backpacks with the
largest combat penalties, it can be used when training combat skills to
drastically increased experience gained.

It can be bought from any General [Item Trader](Item_Trader.md "wikilink")
for c. 3,000.

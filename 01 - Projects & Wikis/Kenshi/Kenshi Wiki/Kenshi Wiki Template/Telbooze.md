Telbooze is a small mountain town located southeast of
[Brink](Brink_(Alpha).md "wikilink"). The area is apparently patrolled by
the [Imperial Lords](Imperial_Lords.md "wikilink"), however Telbooze itself
is owned by [Dead Cat](Dead_Cat.md "wikilink"). Nearby towns include
[Trader's Edge](Trader's_Edge_(Alpha).md "wikilink") and
[Eyesocket](Eyesocket_(Alpha).md "wikilink"). Telbooze itself is balanced
precariously on the side of a mountain.

**Leviathan Coast** is found in the northwestern reaches of the map
situated north of the [Cannibal Plains](Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink"),
[The Iron Trail](The_Iron_Trail.md "wikilink") and everything else on the
eastern half of the continent. As the name implies,
the[Leviathans](Leviathan.md "wikilink") are common in this region, but
also several other types of [Fauna](Fauna.md "wikilink"). Remnants of the
old Second Empire can be seen in the entire region, with some of the
ruins seemingly already scavenged by the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) that periodically appear in these
areas.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") or [](Minor_Outposts.md) in the Leviathan Coast. This zone
does not spawn Camps.

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Lost Armouryx](Lost_Armoury.md "wikilink") 3
- [Old Empire Watchtower](Old_Empire_Watchtower.md "wikilink") x 2
- [Lost Library](Lost_Library.md "wikilink")

#### Aesthetic Ruins

*These locations show up on the map, although the player cannot interact
with anything at this location.*

- [Fallen Tower](Fallen_Tower.md "wikilink")

### Nests

[*Nests*](Nest.md "wikilink")*are temporary locations which can spawn
randomly and typically belong to [Animals](Fauna.md "wikilink").*

- [Nest of Beak Things](Nest_of_Beak_Things.md "wikilink")
- [Wolf Den](Wolf_Den.md "wikilink")
- [Swamp Raptor Nest](Swamp_Raptor_Nest.md "wikilink")

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

- [Garru](Garru.md "wikilink")
- [Leviathan](Leviathan.md "wikilink")
- [Beak Thing](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink")
- [River Raptor](River_Raptor.md "wikilink")
- [Tech Hunters](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink")

## Environment

The area has many areas of fertility 90% above and also large swathes of
stone mines of 100% quality can be found here. The iron nodes here are
fairly frequent, and always have a 100% quality. Copper on the other
hand is very sparse in terms of nodes and only give out 55% quality cap.

The majestic [Leviathans](Leviathan.md "wikilink") are commonly found
treading the earth here. They are hunted for their precious
[pearls](Leviathan_Pearl.md "wikilink") (12,000 cats). Packs of
[Garru](Garru.md "wikilink") can also be found roaming around often falling
prey to the [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") in the region. The
abundance of wildlife provides bases with leather for light armour and
meat for food.

### Weather

*This zone has the 'coastal' season. Seasons may cause harmful [](Weather_Effects.md) or be purely aesthetic.*

- Clear nothing
- Light rain
- Heavy rain
- Light rain acid

## Tips

1.  Being secluded on the northern reaches of the map means that you
    won't find anyone to trade with you except the [](Western_Hive.md) in the southwestern part of the zone,
    you may create safehouses leading to [](Flotsam_Village.md) or the [](Fishing_Village_(Deadcat).md) passing through the
    northern part of Cannibal Plains for your trade goods and other
    needs.
2.  The Leviathan Coast is a bandit free area but sometimes cannibals
    from the Cannibal Plains would harass you if you are too near to the
    south. Build further north to avoid confrontation but this will
    create a higher travel time for your trade route.
3.  As with building any base in places with hostile wildlife, a full
    enclosing wall is a must to avoid disruption of everyday economic
    activities.
4.  Leviathans are not aggressive creatures therefore they are not a
    threat to your base, hunt these gentle giants only when you are
    really ready.

**Tech Hunters**are adventurers dedicated to scouring the ancient ruins
of the world in search of lost technologies and artifacts. Alternatively
they also serve as mercenaries or shopkeepers selling equipment for
adventuring. They generally work for the
[Machinists](Machinists.md "wikilink"), supplying them with the materials
they need for their research. They also use their knowledge of the world
and its inhabitants to help newer adventurers, providing tips and guides
in the [Tech Hunter's Notes](Tech_Hunter's_Notes_Series.md "wikilink")
series of books.

## Locations

## Trivia

- Once dismissed, all [](Playable_Characters.md) become Tech Hunters. This
  is due to the fact that the Tech Hunters faction uses the ID of the
  old Drifters faction from the [old world](Old_World.md "wikilink").
  Therefore, technically, dismissed characters were supposed to become
  [Drifters](Drifters.md "wikilink"), but the system was never updated to
  use their new ID.
- Trepp is supposedly one of the Tech Hunters captains, and can be heard
  by other comrades that she is a woman that "breaks your balls", which
  probably refers to her recklessness. Her quotes can be most often
  found in the **Tech Hunter's Note Series**.
- [Skeletal repair beds](Skeleton_Repair_Bed.md "wikilink") become free
  once [allied](Guide_to_Faction_Relations.md "wikilink").
- From the [](Tech_Hunter's_Notes_Series.md) we know the names of
  some of the more prominent Tech Hunters: Fish, Trepp and Zed. However,
  they do not spawn in game.

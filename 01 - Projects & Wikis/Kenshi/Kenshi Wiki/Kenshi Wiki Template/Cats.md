The monetary unit used in Kenshi is known as **Cats**. These can be
acquired by the player from selling looted junk to merchants. They are
found in their item form by looting enemies such as nobles or in
containers within ancient ruins such as barrels.

Although Cats do exist as their item-form within containers or within
the inventories of some enemies, when looted the Cats will automatically
be added to the players total Cats and the item will be deleted.

Cats are used to buy [Items](Items.md "wikilink"),
[Armour](Armour.md "wikilink"), [Weapons](Weapons.md "wikilink") and hire
recruits or mercenaries. The amount of Cats which the player starts out
with is dependent on the [Game Start](Game_Starts.md "wikilink") that the
player has chosen (e.g. Wanderer starts out with 1,000 Cats).

### History

Cats previously were described as being short for "Catan Credits" and
named after the town of [Catan](Catun_(Alpha).md "wikilink"), later known
as [Catun](Catun.md "wikilink"). This has changed since the Southeast
quarter of the map was released, and now Cats are named after the former
emperor of the Second Empire, [Cat-Lon](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink").

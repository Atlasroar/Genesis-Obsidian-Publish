**Bonedogs** are canine-like [creatures](Fauna.md "wikilink") which roam
the wastes in large packs. They are fairly hostile when other
inhabitants of the world roam into their territory. These creatures,
however wild by nature, have been domesticated by people as trusty
companions and loyal guardians.

Wild Bonedogs are drawn to the scent of dead bodies and will devour any
they find. They will not attempt to devour living characters, even if
they are playing dead. If a limb is found a Bonedog will "Play 'Limb'"
where they run around with a severed limb until given a specific Move
Order. Once they are done with the Move Order they will go back to
playing. Other Bonedogs will chase the limb carrying one with "Limb
Envy".

They are commonly kept as pets by some factions, like [](Rebel_Farmers.md) and [](Bounty_Hunters.md).

If you have a bonedog companion, keep in mind it will not eat until it
reaches approximately 220 hunger, rather than a humanoid companion's
250. While this may seem ideal, bonedogs also have 200% hunger rate.
They eat any food as well as any [](Severed_Limbs.md) that are laying on the ground.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Bonedogs can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 18 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 5 piercing damage which Bonedogs
have.

<u>**Variant 1**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.77961008 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

<u>**Variant 2**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.83928 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

<u>**Variant 3**</u>

**Cut =** 18 + 0.89894992 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt** **=** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

## Trivia

- Bonedogs, as other non-pack domestic animals, have a
  [backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") slot and used to be able to equip all
  normal backpacks. This was eventually removed, though the slot still
  remains.
- The Guy with a Dog start used to begin with a [](Mountain_Dog.md) pup, a noticeably stronger animal,
  instead of a Bonedog pup.
- The [Desert Sabre](Desert_Sabre.md "wikilink") does 25% additional damage
  to bonedogs.
- Bonedogs (Like many organic animals in Kenshi) have self healing. This
  means that so long as a Bonedog is not knocked unconscious, it will
  "bandage" cut wounds without needing a first aid kit.

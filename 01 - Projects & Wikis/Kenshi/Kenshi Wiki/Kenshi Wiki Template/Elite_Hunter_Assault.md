**Elite Hunter Assault** is an [event](Events.md "wikilink") that can
trigger from being an enemy of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) and living within 9,000 meters of a
[United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") location, or as a response to
defeating the **Elite Hunter Assault**, [](Eyegore's_Assault.md), or [](Noble's_Wrath_Assault.md). At least one noble from the
following list must be alive and free to trigger the event: [](Emperor_Tengu.md), [Lord Inaba](Lord_Inaba.md "wikilink"),
[Lord Nagata](Lord_Nagata.md "wikilink"), [](Lord_Yoshinaga.md), [](Lady_Sanda.md), [Lady Tsugi](Lady_Tsugi.md "wikilink"). If
all the nobles listed are killed or captured, the event will be unable
to trigger except as a response to defeating **Elite Hunter Assault**.

When triggered, the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") will
launch an assault on the player's base. This assault will consist of 3-5
[Elite Hunters](Elite_Hunter.md "wikilink"), led by an additional [](Elite_Hunter.md).

When the assault arrives, the leader will give a short speech
introducing themselves, and then they will attack the player's gates and
characters. If victorious, the assault will leave shortly afterward. If
defeated, there is a chance to trigger the [](Eyegore's_Assault.md) event, or another **Elite Hunter
Assault**. The chance for each varies depending on the source of this
event.

If triggered as a territorial event, [](Eyegore's_Assault.md) will have a 20% chance to trigger
in 72-100 hours, while **Elite Hunter Assault** will have a 20% chance
to trigger in 72-100 hours.

If triggered in response to defeating a variant of [](Noble's_Wrath_Assault.md) that is triggered by
killing/capturing a noble, or defeating [](Eyegore's_Assault.md), [](Eyegore's_Assault.md) will have a 40% chance to trigger
in 72-100 hours assuming [Eyegore](Eyegore.md "wikilink") has not been
killed or captured, and **Elite Hunter Assault** will have a 20% chance
to trigger in 72-100 hours.

If triggered as response to defeating a special dialogue triggered
variant of the [Noble's Wrath Assault](Noble's_Wrath_Assault.md "wikilink")
event, only the **Elite Hunter Assault** can trigger as a response, and
will have a 60% chance to trigger in 72-144 hours. This next one will
also have the same chances if defeated, and the next one, and so on.

And if triggered in response to defeating the **Elite Hunter Assault**,
except as mentioned above in the [](Noble's_Wrath_Assault.md) dialogue trigger variant,
[Eyegore's Assault](Eyegore's_Assault.md "wikilink") will have a 35% chance
to trigger in 72-144 hours, and **Elite Hunter Assault** will have a 25%
chance to trigger in 72-144 hours.

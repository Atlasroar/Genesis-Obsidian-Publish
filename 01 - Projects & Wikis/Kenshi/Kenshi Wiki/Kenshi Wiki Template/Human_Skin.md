**Human Skin** is a [Body Armour](Body_Armour.md "wikilink") worn by [](Skin_Bandits.md). Alas it provides no actual armour
protection.

This item is quite similar in appearance to the [](Human_Skin_Suit.md).

Contrary to popular belief, [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) will see through this disguise for
some strange reason.

## Appearance

Just humans being humans, doing normal human things.

We are not sure why it's a separate item, all humans have one so they
can do normal human things like breathing through their nostrils and
singing human songs.

## Crafting

It cannot be crafted and can only be found in containers in [](Skinhouse_HQ.md) and [Skinhouses](Skinhouse.md "wikilink").

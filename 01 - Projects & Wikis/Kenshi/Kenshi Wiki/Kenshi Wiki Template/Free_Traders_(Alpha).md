Free Traders are a neutral [faction](Factions_(Alpha).md "wikilink") that
don't own any towns but do have outposts northeast of [](Black_Scratch_(Alpha).md) and south of
[Eyesocket](Eyesocket_(Alpha).md "wikilink"). Free Traders' outpost are in
a Outpost s-IIIÂ and are part [Flophouse](Flophouse.md "wikilink"), medical
station and Trader in one.

Free Traders start with no negative relationships with anyone.

Unlike other Flophouses in version 0.50, all the beds at a Free Traders
outpost will function properly and characters will be able to sleep in
them to recover.

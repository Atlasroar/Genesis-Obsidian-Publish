**Iron Clubs** are [Blunt class weapons](Blunt_Weapons.md "wikilink")
introduced in update 0.42. With a focus on [](Stun_damage.md), they make decent tools for capturing
bandits and other criminals for their bounties. Packs of
[Cannibals](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") and [](Starving_Bandits.md) are known to carry these, often of
the rusted variety.

This weapon has inventory dimensions of **1x7**. It can be equipped in
both the primary and secondary weapon slots.

The ability to make these weapons is unlocked by researching [](Basic_Weapon_Smithing_(Tech).md).

## Trivia

- When originally implemented **Iron Clubs** were classified as
  [Sabres](Sabres.md "wikilink"). This was fixed in version 0.90.0 when the
  [Blunt](Blunt.md "wikilink") class was implemented.
- Even though there is a [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") texture, it does
  not spawn in game, making it impossible to get your hands on without
  mods.

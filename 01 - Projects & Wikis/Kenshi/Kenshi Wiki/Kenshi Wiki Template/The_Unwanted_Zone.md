**The Unwanted Zone** fully lives up to its name, unless players have
very skilled fighters and are in need of [](Animal_Skin.md) or [Raw Meat](Raw_Meat.md "wikilink"). It is
densely populated by [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") and
[Crabs](Crab.md "wikilink"). There are many Nests in this Zone, making it a
good source of [Crab Eggs](Crab_Egg.md "wikilink") and [](Beak_Thing_Egg.md).

Players hoping for a good path from [](Stobe's_Gamble.md) (home to the
[Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink")) to [](The_Outlands.md) (home of Anti-Slaver recruit
[Bo](Bo.md "wikilink")) are recommended to go around this Zone or have a
member capable of using a [Falling Sun](Falling_Sun.md "wikilink") or other
anti-Beak Thing weaponry to deal with the abundant and fast-running
[Gutters](Gutters.md "wikilink") in these areas.

## Tips

- Given the density of Beak Things in this area, it is possible that
  some of the Beak Things found in the neighboring Venge were migrated
  away from this area.

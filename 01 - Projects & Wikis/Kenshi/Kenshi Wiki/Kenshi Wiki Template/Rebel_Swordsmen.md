**Rebel Swordsmen** are an insurgent faction allied with the [](Rebel_Farmers.md), although, unlike them, they do not
engage in banditry. Allying with the Rebel Farmers increases player
relations with them. However, Rebel Swordsmen don't start existing until
after some of the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") Nobles are
killed or kidnapped. They appear to be a more organized and well
equipped militia group of the Rebel Farmers movement, responsible for
patrolling areas and policing the areas after UC is overthrown. Much
like the former Rebel Farmers, patrols of Rebel Swordsmen tend to be
malnourished.

If the [Empire Peasants](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md "wikilink") control [](Major_Towns.md), there may be some Rebel Swordsmen
Barracks in those locations.

**Narcotics** were once a Trade Good in older versions of Kenshi that
could be bought and sold to make a profit. They were sold byÂ traders in
towns. The item was introduced in the game at the same time as Hashish,
and took up the same space and had the same function as
[Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink"), which is likely the reason why it was
removed.

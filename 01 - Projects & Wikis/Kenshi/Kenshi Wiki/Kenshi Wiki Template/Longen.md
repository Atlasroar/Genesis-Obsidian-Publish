**Longen** is the leader of the [](Traders_Guild.md), and has [](Diplomatic_Status.md). He resides in the Faction HQ in
[Trader's Edge](Trader's_Edge.md "wikilink"), where he usually spends time
in his throne room.

He has the Smart [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

Characters can speak with Longen and hear him complain that not one of
his "so-called guards" has put an end to [Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink")'s
insanity. If Tinfist has already been defeated, Longen might award the
player instead.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If **Longen** is imprisoned or killed there are several World States
that would trigger.

Trader's Edge would fall into ruins under Traders Guild control or
handed over to [Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") if [](Emperor_Tengu.md) is also imprisoned or killed, while
[Tinfist](Tinfist.md "wikilink") is alive and free. It can also fall under
the control of [Empire Peasants](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md "wikilink") if
**Tinfist**, **Tengu** and **Longen** are all either killed or
imprisoned. This condition will also spawn [](Boss_Simion.md) in Trader's Edge (as a member of the
Empire Peasants) if he isn't yet killed or imprisoned.

[Heng](Heng.md "wikilink") would become half-destroyed, or handed over to
**Empire Peasants** if **Tengu** is also killed or imprisoned (with
varying degrees of prosperity depending on
[Tinfist's](Tinfist.md "wikilink") status; more prosperous if he is alive
and free).

If **Longen** and [Slave Master Wada](Slave_Master_Wada.md "wikilink") are
both killed or imprisoned, Heft will become malnourished if it's under
UC rule and is not already malnourished.

[Starving Vagrants](Starving_Vagrant.md "wikilink") and [](Caravan_Trader_Boss.md) patrols would cease to spawn.

[Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink") patrols would become less
frequent and less people when **Longen** is imprisoned or killed.
Further decreasing in number if more northern Slave Masters/Mistresses
are imprisoned or killed.

If **Longen** and [Slave Master Grande](Slave_Master_Grande.md "wikilink")
are both killed or imprisoned, **Slave Traders** patrols will cease to
spawn in the [Grey Desert](Grey_Desert.md "wikilink").

If **Longen**, [Slave Master Ruben](Slave_Master_Ruben.md "wikilink") and
[Slave Mistress Ren](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md "wikilink") are all killed or
imprisoned, **Slave Traders** patrols will cease to spawn in
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink").

If **Longen**, [Lady Kana](Lady_Kana.md "wikilink") and [](Slave_Master_Haga.md) are all killed or imprisoned, Slave
Traders patrols will cease to spawn in [](The_Great_Desert.md).

If **Longen** or **Lady Kana** are either imprisoned or killed, the
[Traders Guild Visit](Traders_Guild_Visit.md "wikilink") should no longer
trigger.

**Longen** is considered to be one of the Northern Slave
Masters/Mistresses alongside with [Lady Kana](Lady_Kana.md "wikilink"),
[Slave Mistress Ren](Slave_Mistress_Ren.md "wikilink"), [](Slave_Master_Grande.md), [](Slave_Master_Haga.md), [](Slave_Master_Wada.md) and [](Slave_Master_Ruben.md). Killing/Imprisoning them will
further decrease [Slave Hunter](Slave_Hunter.md "wikilink"),
[Manhunter](Manhunter.md "wikilink") and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md) patrols, reducing to none when all of
them are killed/imprisoned.

If **Tinfist** is alive and free, it can cause a potential-spawn of
**Anti-Slavers** when **Longen** is imprisoned or killed. Further
increasing if **Lady Kana** is also imprisoned or killed.

If **Longen** is killed or imprisoned along with **Emperor Tengu**,
while **Tinfist** remains alive and free, the [](Free_Settlement.md) will turn into [](The_Free_City.md).

## Trivia

- If Longen is brought in front of [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), he will appear to be dismayed
  by your action and tell you to leave.
- If Longen is taken [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") leader of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md), She will appear confused and
  distressed by your action. She will then tell you "We have enough on
  our plate right now" and tell you take him somewhere else.
- Longen has an exceptional ability at recognizing escaped
  slaves/ex-slaves, even the ones in a disguise.

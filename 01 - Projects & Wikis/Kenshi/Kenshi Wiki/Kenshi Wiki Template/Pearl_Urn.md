**Pearl Urn** is a useless [Junk](Junk.md "wikilink") Item: no purpose
other than trading and only worth a small amount. This item can be found
in Residential Buildings. When starting out, stealing this item along
with other junk can help players increase
their [Thievery](Thievery.md "wikilink") stat with little risk (if the
building is empty) and reward.

It is quite possible that this item is made from [](Leviathan_Pearl.md), alongside other pearl-related items
such as [Pearl Cup](Pearl_Cup.md "wikilink"), [](Pearl_Sword_Holder.md) and [](Pearl_Vase.md).

As many other Pearl items, it can be bought from the [](Hive_Trader.md) in Hive villages.

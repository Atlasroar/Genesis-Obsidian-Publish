The **Southern Hive** is a [](Hostile_Factions.md) of [hivers](Hive.md "wikilink")
located in the regions of the [Royal Valley](Royal_Valley.md "wikilink")
and [Greyshelf](Greyshelf.md "wikilink"), south of [](Flats_Lagoon.md) and [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink"). Those
who enter their land will be met with swarms of
[Droneguard](Droneguard.md "wikilink") and, upon reaching the [](Southern_Hive_(Location).md) itself, will encounter [](Elite_Droneguard.md) and the [](Queen_of_the_South.md).

Southern Hivers are mostly identical to [](Western_Hive.md), except for the pink coloration of
their skin and white line patterns covering their bodies (and slight
differentiation in skill and bleeding rate). Compared to their western
cousins though, Southern Hivers are far more aggressive. They are
obsessed with devouring and/or sacrificing any intruder or Hiveless to
their [King](King.md "wikilink"). Because of their intense xenophobia
towards the peoples of "the Faraway", as they call the lands outside
their territory, Hiveless/Ronin Southerners are extremely rare.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

## Trivia

- Given their hostility towards **Western Hive**, and that they start to
  invade immediately to the regions where [](Hive_Bandit.md) and [Fogmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink")
  Appear after the [Western Hive Queen](The_Queen.md "wikilink") is
  killed/imprisoned, it's likely that they are waiting until their
  'producer' is taken out and then launch attack on WH in order to
  exterminate their race.
- All Southern Hivers are considered human to other factions. They still
  act as their western counter parts in clothing but are treated as if
  they are human.
- Southern Hive will not attack Skeletons if the player faction is
  neutral towards them, as Southern Hive does not see Skeletons as
  viable targets for the [King](King.md "wikilink") to eat.

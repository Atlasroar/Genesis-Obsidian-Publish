After researching **Hydroponics**, characters can research how to make
hydroponic growing stations for four different types of crops. Only
[Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink"), [Riceweed](Riceweed.md "wikilink"),
[Greenfruit](Greenfruit.md "wikilink"), and
[Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink") can be grown with hydroponics.
Hydroponics Bays are smaller than outdoor farms, but can allow for bases
to be built in any area without concern for what
[Environment](Environment.md "wikilink") it is.

Hydroponic farms require [Water](Water.md "wikilink") and
[Power](Power.md "wikilink") to grow. If there is not enough power, farms
can pause growth or grow at a decreased rate.

After completing all the research, characters can build Hydroponics with
4 [Iron Plates](Iron_Plate.md "wikilink"), 2 [](Electrical_Components.md), and 10 of their desired
crop.

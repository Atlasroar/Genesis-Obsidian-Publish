The **Rain Collector** is a building which collects
[Water](Water.md "wikilink") when it is raining. It can be constructed
after researching [Rain Collector](Rain_Collector_(Tech).md "wikilink").

Rain Collectors are the only water source which can be built in
[](Player-Owned_Buildings_in_Town.md). This building is fully
automated and does not require any workers.

| Building       | Material cost                            | Output                                    | Efficiency |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|------------|

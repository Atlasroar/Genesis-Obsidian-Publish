**Armour King's Thralls** are shop guards for the [](Armour_King.md). They can be found in the Armour King's
Shop in [Drowned Ruins](Drowned_Ruins.md "wikilink").

The Armour King will talk about his Thralls if the player lingers in his
store long enough. The Armour King captured his Thralls and reprogrammed
them. He claims that, despite their lack of heads, they are very good at
detecting thievery. They have sound sensors in their hands, allegedly.

Only the Armour King can raise the alarm, the thralls will just stand
there "watching" you.

Like their master, they belong to the [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink")
faction.

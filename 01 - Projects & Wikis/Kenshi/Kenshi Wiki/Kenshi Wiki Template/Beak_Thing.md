**Beak Things**, also known as **Gutters**, are one of the most
dangerous creatures in the world. They are found in
[Vain](Vain.md "wikilink"), the [](Leviathan_Coast.md), [The Crater](The_Crater.md "wikilink"),
and [Gut](Gut.md "wikilink"). They can also roam into the North-West
[Cannibal Plains](The_Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink") from the [](Leviathan_Coast.md) at times. Their nests can have
between 1 and 30 [Beak Thing Eggs](Beak_Thing_Egg.md "wikilink"). These
creatures are extremely fast, hit hard and eat unconscious prey, be they
dead or alive. They can also spawn as very old (Age 1.9-2.1)
[Elders](Elder_Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") in the High Bonefields and
Bonefields. Their movement speed and range of their attacks are
determined based off their age, which makes the Elders capable of
reaching the highest speeds in the game.

## Dealing with Beak Things

One strategy to kill these creatures is by having one tank/attacker
taking the hits, while other members shoot at it with crossbows. If the
group lacks ranged weapons, it is wise to surround the Beak Thing from
different sides in order to avoid its multiple enemy attack.

The only attack Beak Things have is by swinging their head downwards. It
takes quite some time for their attack to strike someone due to their
long attack animation, so if they can move away (NOT sideways, they can
turn) from the Beak Thing, they will avoid the attack unharmed. Also,
the attack can be blocked if the block is made for upwards attacks.

Like most animals in Kenshi, Beak Thing attacks mostly deal cutting
damage, which is very dangerous to let stack up. On the upside,
Skeletons can quickly fix the damage if they get hit.

[Polearms](Polearms.md "wikilink") and Naginatas are fantastic at dealing
with Beak Things due to their +50% bonus damage to animals on top of
their very fast attack animations. A [](Falling_Sun.md) will also make short work of Beak Things
capable of clearing through waves of them provided you are able to wield
it correctly.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which Beak
Things have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

## Trivia

- The typical length of a Beak Thing's neck is approximately 2 meters or
  6'7".
- They can be easily kited due to their long attack animation.
- Like with all animals (Minus Gorillos, Garrus and Domesticated Bulls)
  Beak Things have insanely high damage output but are hard countered by
  armour.
- In older versions, Beak Things could grow larger than mountains due to
  a misplaced decimal, and had a crest-like membrane behind their heads.
  They could also speak.

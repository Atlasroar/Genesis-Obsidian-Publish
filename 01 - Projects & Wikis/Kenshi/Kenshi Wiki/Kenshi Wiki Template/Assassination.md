Assassination is a [stat](Statistics.md "wikilink") that affects the
player's ability to successfully knock out non-player characters. It is
useful when players want to get rid of a person or a group of people
without fighting or alarming the guards. Players can attempt to stealth
knock-out any character in the world. Stealth knock-outs are not
possible on animal characters.

Players earn experience in this stat for successful and unsuccessful
attempts. Failed attempts grant 3x more experience than successes. The
[Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink"), Assassination, Thievery or Defense
skill of the target decreases your chances of knocking them out.
Whichever impacts it the most. Toughness effects the chances 2x more
than the other stats. (So a target with 30 Toughness would be harder to
knock out than a unit with 59 in defense as an example) A knocked out
person can be looted the same way as if they were asleep.

## Buildings

You can train Assassination at [The Hub](The_Hub.md "wikilink") or any
other city with a Thieves tower after joining the [](Shinobi_Thieves.md). They have Assassination Dummies on
the first floor of their tower.

Player Characters can also build their own [](Assassination_Dummy.md) after researching [](Assassin_Training_(Tech).md).

## Tips

- It is recommended that players avoid knocking out shopkeepers because
  of a bug which causes the shop's residents to despawn. The shop's
  items will not restock if this occurs. This can be fixed through
  [importing saved games](Main_Menu.md "wikilink").
- Players can also attempt stealth knock-outs on any eating or
  worshiping [Fogmen](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") in the [](Fog_Islands.md). The Fogmen will be too distracted in
  their task and will likely not initiate combat after a failed attempt.
- An easy way to train this is to stealth knock-out characters within
  [Prisoner Cages](Prisoner_Cage.md "wikilink"). This can be done easily
  against any enslaved characters in places such as
  [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") and [](Reaver_Camp.md).
- Right clicking on one of your characters that is sleeping in a bed you
  don't own will allow you to perform a stealth knock-out on your own
  character and get assassination experience.

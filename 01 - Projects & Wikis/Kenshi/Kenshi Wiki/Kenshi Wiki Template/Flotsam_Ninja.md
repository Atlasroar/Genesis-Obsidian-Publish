**Flotsam Ninjas** are people who escaped the oppression of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and taken refuge in [](Flotsam_Village.md), they are the rank-and-file
soldiers of [Flotsam Ninjas](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink").

## Interactions

The first time a player enters the Flotsam Village they will be
interrogated by a Flotsam Ninja, usually the leader of the gate guard.
Being aggressive, uncooperative or claiming you are an Okranite pilgrim
will cause them to attack. Patrols of **Flotsam Ninjas** can be talked
to if one has a [Note From Moll](Note_From_Moll.md "wikilink") in their
inventory. If they have a squad size greater than 4, they will then
bodyguard the player for 72 hours.

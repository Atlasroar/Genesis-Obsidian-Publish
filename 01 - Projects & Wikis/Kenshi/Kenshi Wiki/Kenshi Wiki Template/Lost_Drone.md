**Lost Drones** are [factionless](Factions.md "wikilink")
[hivers](Hive.md "wikilink"). They can be found wandering
[Bast](Bast_(Zone).md "wikilink"), [Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink"), [](Flats_Lagoon_(Zone).md), [Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink"),
[Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink"), [](Okran's_Pride.md), [](Okran's_Valley.md), [Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink"),
[Stenn Desert](Stenn_Desert.md "wikilink"), [](The_Great_Desert.md), and [](The_Hook.md).

These hivers were likely separated or exiled from the [](Western_Hive.md). They are not to be confused with the
[Lost Hiver](Lost_Hiver.md "wikilink") drones. Given their abundance in
both [Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) areas, it's likely that these type of
Hivers are the source for the majority of Hiver slaves in
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") for the HN and [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md) for the UC.

If they get inside or too close to holy nation towns, the leading [](Holy_Sentinel.md) will mark that their kind are not
welcome there and arrest them to later send them to
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink"). They are also prime targets for [](Slave_Hunter.md) and [](Noble_Hunter.md) if they find themselves in United
Cities territory.

Lost Drones can join the player faction if they encounter a Hive player
character in a Player Outpost. Once recruited, they will have the
"Player HIVER Ronin" Dialogue Package. It also seems like they have
unique dialogue with Вeep specifically.

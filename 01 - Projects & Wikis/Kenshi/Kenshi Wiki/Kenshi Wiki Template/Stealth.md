Stealth is an implemented feature of Kenshi as of version Beta 0.90.

Stealth is one of the core Thievery skills and without leveling the
skill a player will have a hard time with
[Thievery](Thievery.md "wikilink") and
[Assassination](Assassination.md "wikilink"). Using stealth, one can sneak
around undetected, and knock out unsuspecting opponents from behind, if
ones assassination skill is high enough. Stealth also affects how well a
[Disguise](Disguise.md "wikilink") will work when used to enter a enemy
town. In the end if you want to be a thief you need stealth!

## Affected by

- Cover. Hiding behind a bed is better than being out in the open.
  Interior walls can prevent sight, but footsteps may still be heard(?)
- Distance. It is easier to hide from a guy at the other side of the
  street than a guy right in front of you.
- Light. Refer to Stealth Mode below.
- Weight. Carrying heavy things and armor will negatively affect your
  stealthiness.
- Wounds. They will make you slower and noisier.

## Stealth mode

![](Eye_and_Sun_2.jpg "Eye_and_Sun_2.jpg") When you press the stealth
button two icons appear above the characters head, an eye and sun.
![](Screenshot_26.jpg "Screenshot_26.jpg") **Blue Eye** -This means you
are currently unseen by any NPC around you.

**Yellow Eye** - This means you are within an NPC's line of sight but
you remain unseen. A yellow arrow will come up showing the direction of
the NPC you might be spotted by. You have a small amount of time to find
a better hiding spot before the NPC detects you.
![](Red_eye_and_Red_Arrows.jpg "Red_eye_and_Red_Arrows.jpg") **Red
Eye** - This means you've been spotted by an NPC, and they can currently
see you.

**Sun** - The amount of light currently on your player. This includes
any artificial light source your character walks into. The sun will be
half-dimmed while in dim light, and fully shaded when in complete
darkness.

\*BUG\* Light will bleed through doors

## Tips

- You don't need to be around enemies to train and can simply sneak
  around friendly / neutral towns to train the skill up. But sneaking
  around hostile characters give a significantly more amount of xp.
- Finding a [Nest](Nest.md "wikilink") at the edge of a zone is a good way
  to train fast. Nests spawn numerous hostiles, and because they are
  bound to the nest their movements are constrained and therefore
  predictable. Staying at the edge of the zone decreased the likelihood
  of a returning patrol sandwiching your party.
- One of the fastest (albeit gamey) ways to level up stealth is to head
  to the Lost Library located northeast of Rebirth. There is usually a
  fairly large pack of blood spiders guarding the area. From there you
  can use the road that bends downward into the ruins as a hiding spot
  while you stealth run your character back and forth between the
  spiders and the road bend, retreating just as the eye hits red. This
  will level your stealth insanely fast. At night, you can get very
  close to the spiders without them seeing you, allowing you to use this
  method round the clock. Keep in mind they can still spot you at night
  if you get too close. (Credit to Gamer Guide from YouTube)
- Remember to remove anything heavy in your inventory including Armour
  that has a negative stealth rating when attempting to use stealth.
- Once a character becomes good at sneaking, they becomeÂ invisible to
  lower level NPCs.

## Other notes

- Above skill level 30 (total - including effect bonuses) player gains
  the "ninja" (also called the infamous Naruto run) run animation and
  increase in movement speed while sneaking.

Located east of [Stormgap Coast](Stormgap_Coast.md "wikilink"), the
**Forbidden Isle** is a hostile and miserable place. Inhabited by
legions of [Iron Spiders](Iron_Spider.md "wikilink"), likely originating
from the [Spider Factory](Spider_Factory.md "wikilink") situated in the
middle of the isle and aggressive [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md) who wish to lay claim to the lost
secrets, this small land mass should be explored by either the mad or
the courageous. Aside from the hostile enemies, there is often a blanket
of acid rain that covers the island making exploration even more
perilous without the proper protective gear.

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") or [](Minor_Outposts.md) in the Forbidden Isle. This zone
does not spawn [Nests](Nest.md "wikilink") or Camps.

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink")
- [Spider Factory](Spider_Factory.md "wikilink")

### Homeless Spawns

*These are squads which spawn without being tied to a location, camp, or
nest. This list is in order of likelihood.*

- [Iron Spider](Iron_Spider.md "wikilink")
- [Tech Hunters](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink")

*These squads can potentially spawn in this zone if certain [](World_States.md) have been reached.*

- [Goats](Goat.md "wikilink")
- [Garrus](Garru.md "wikilink")

[Weather Effects](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") or be purely aesthetic.*

After the [Spider Foreman](Spider_Foreman.md "wikilink") is killed, wild
goats and garru can become homeless spawns. [ru:Запретный

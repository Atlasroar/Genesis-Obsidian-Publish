are [Buildings](Buildings.md "wikilink") for growing
[Cactus](Cactus.md "wikilink"). Once built, they require water to grow, but
no further manpower is needed until harvest time.

After harvesting, the farm will continue to produce as long as it has
water.

When upgrading a farm, any water that was in the farm will remain upon
completion of the upgrade. Further, the cactus material cost will only
increase by 10 per upgrade. The table shows the amount required to build
a farm outright. The "time left to harvest" column only begins to tick
down once the crops are ready for harvest.

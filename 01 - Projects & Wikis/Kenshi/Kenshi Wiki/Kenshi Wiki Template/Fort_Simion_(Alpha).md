**Fort Simion** (formerly known as **Fisher**) is the southernmost town
in Kenshi. It is located on a small hill overlooking a plain. Nearby
towns include [Skinner's Roam](Skinner's_Roam_(Alpha).md "wikilink") and
[Black Scratch](Black_Scratch_(Alpha).md "wikilink"). Also, as of v0.27.1
Fort Simion is the only town with a
[faction](Factions_(Alpha).md "wikilink") associated to it. Post v0.27,
this town was renamed from Fisher to Fort Simion. It is controlled by
[The Holy Empire](The_Holy_Empire.md "wikilink") faction.

[Fort Simion](Fort_Simion.md "wikilink") appears in the final release of
the game as a much less impressive location initially controlled by the
[Rebel Farmers](Rebel_Farmers.md "wikilink").

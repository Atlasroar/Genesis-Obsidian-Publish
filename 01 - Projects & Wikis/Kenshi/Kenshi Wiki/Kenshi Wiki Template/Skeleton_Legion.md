![](Skeleton_Legion.jpg "Skeleton_Legion.jpg") **Skeleton Legion** is a
faction found in the [Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink").

## Background

The Skeleton Legion was created some time after the fall of the [](Second_Empire.md). Nothing is known about this shadowy
faction, however, it is likely that the faction is a successor group to
the defunct Hydraulic Knights, or a counterpart. The faction's
commanders and officers are also likely the few skeletons that
sympathized and stayed loyal to Mad Cat-Lon, as Legionnaires of the
faction are not thralls, whereas it's main forces, Legion Thralls, are
numerous and make the bulk of the group.

## History of Narko

**Narko**, a deity described as the demoness of darkness. She is the
dark counterpart to [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink") said to be cast out into
the underworld. It is written within the holy scriptures that
NarkoÂ exists in a place without light, and that she uses her darkness to
corrupt and bribe the souls of mortals into sin and heresy.

This ancient doctrine of belief is one of the primary reasons women are
oppressed within [Holy Nation](Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") society, as Narko
was regarded as female and evil.

Other non-human races are treated with disdain and usually enslaved or
slain in the name of [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink"). The [](Holy_Nation.md) particularly hates the skeleton race,
they regard them as dark agents of Narko.

## Trivia

- "Narko" is simply "Okran" spelled backwards.

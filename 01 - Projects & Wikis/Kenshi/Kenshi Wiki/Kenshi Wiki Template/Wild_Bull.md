**Wild Bulls** are [herbivorous](Herbivore.md "wikilink")
[animals](Fauna.md "wikilink") which can be found roaming the wild in
Kenshi. There are other types of Bulls, such as [](Domesticated_Bull.md) which can be purchased by the
player and [Pack Bulls](Pack_Bull.md "wikilink") which can be found in
[Trade Caravans](Trade_Caravan "wikilink").

Pack Bulls/Wild Bulls are much stronger in combat than [](Domesticated_Bull.md) due to their damage formula.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which Wild
Bulls have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

**Burn** is a [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") [](Unique_Recruits.md) who can be found just outside his
[Tower](Burn's_Tower.md "wikilink") in the
[Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink"). He is an ex-adventurer who
abandoned that life due to his advancing age, but the player can
convince him to come out for one last adventure before his inevitable
shutdown.

Burn is one of the easiest Skeletons to recruit early in the game. He
has only two unique dialogue lines and uses the Skeleton dialogue
package instead of a unique one.

Note: Burn's lonely vigil outside of his tower may result in conflict
with other locals, potentially resulting in his death.

## Trivia

- There is a dialogue branch where Burn does not check the race of who
  he is speaking to and can state "Skeletons aren't as perishable as
  Skeletons like yourself, but we still have a limit to our existence."

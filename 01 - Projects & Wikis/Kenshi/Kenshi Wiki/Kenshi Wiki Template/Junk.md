Junk is a term used to describe an item with no useful function to serve
other than being a miscellaneous or [](Trade_Goods.md). A majority of junk items can be found in
the upper floors of [Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink"), in locked
or open crates. These items usually weigh a large amount, like the
[Generator Core](Generator_Core.md "wikilink"), or a little, like
[Gears](Gears.md "wikilink"). Junk items can be extremely valuable if your
character(s) have a high enough [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") to carry
them, as well as a [backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") for surplus.

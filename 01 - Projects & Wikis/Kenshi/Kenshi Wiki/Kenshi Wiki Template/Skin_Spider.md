**Skin Spiders**, sometimes called "Flesh Insects" are hostile
carnivores found in the [Spider Plains](Spider_Plains.md "wikilink") and
[Shun](Shun.md "wikilink"). Their attacks deal very high cutting damage.
The Skin Spider's health stats are greater than those of the [](Blood_Spider.md). Skin Spiders—like other spiders—have
high bleeding resistance and will wake up quickly should they be knocked
out.

[Polearms](Polearms.md "wikilink") (except for the
[Staff](Staff.md "wikilink")) offer a 25–50% damage bonus against animals
so it can be extremely useful when fighting Skin Spiders. The [](Desert_Sabre.md) provides a 100% damage bonus against
Skin Spiders.

Instead of consuming the limbs of a downed individual The Skin Spider
will drain the prey's hunger. This rapidly depletes the prey's hunger
level, leading to a [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") penalty. This will
severely hinder the prey's movement speed, making it more difficult to
escape.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which Skin
Spiders have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

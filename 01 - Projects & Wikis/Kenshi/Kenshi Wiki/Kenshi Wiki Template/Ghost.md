**Ghost**is the leader of the [Berserkers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink"). He
can be found in the [Berserker village](Berserker_Village.md "wikilink")
east of [Last Stand](Last_Stand.md "wikilink") camping with many other
[Berserkers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink").

When turning Ghost in to the police in the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md), [](Shek_Warrior.md) will talk about his past.

Before his exile, Ghost was a warrior of the Shek Kingdom, maybe even
one of the Five Indestructibles. His goal was to destroy the Gorrillo
gang. But in the battle with them, the Ghost lost, and the leader of the
group took his captured weapon. For this defeat, the Ghost was expelled
from the Kingdom in disgrace. Subsequently, he became the leader of the
Berserkers - Sheks who did not accept civilization and led a barbaric
lifestyle. Now Sakhon wanders the world as a Ghost of himself, searching
for the peace of an afterlife that he will never achieve.

He has a Maniacal [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

The [Berserker Village](Berserker_Village.md "wikilink") is at times
attacked by [Skin Spiders](Skin_Spider.md "wikilink") which sometimes leads
to Ghost being killed and subsequently eaten.

## Trivia

- Ghost appears to be named Suchon, or at least, before he "died" and
  "became a Ghost", as implied by Hundred Guardian's lines when turning
  him in.

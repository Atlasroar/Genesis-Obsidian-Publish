## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

The death or Imprisonment of **Lady Tsugi** will cause town override
states to be applied to **Brink.**

If **Lady Tsugi** is killed or imprisoned then **Brink** is taken over
by [Reavers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink"). Alternatively if
[Valamon](Valamon.md "wikilink") is also dead or imprisoned then **Brink**
falls to ruins.

Her death/imprisonment would cause Reavers patrols to start spawning at
[Stormgap Coast](Stormgap_Coast.md "wikilink") and [](The_Eye.md) if Valamon is alive and free. Alternatively, if
Lady Tsugi and Valamon are both either killed/imprisoned while [](Crab_Queen.md) is alive and free then [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md) would start spawning at Stormgap
Coast.

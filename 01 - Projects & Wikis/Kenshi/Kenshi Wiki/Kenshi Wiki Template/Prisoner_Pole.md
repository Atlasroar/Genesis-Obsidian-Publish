![](Prisoner_pole_2.png "Prisoner_pole_2.png")\]\] Prisoner Poles are
capturing devices used by [Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink"),
[Fogmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") and [Gurglers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fishmen.md "wikilink"). [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) also utilizes them in
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink"). When a recruit/NPC is captured nearby a
prisoner pole they are locked in and eaten alive by the nearest enemies.
This process can take anywhere from a few seconds to minutes, allowing
for escape. They work a lot like [](Prisoner_Cage.md) but with separate animations. They are
also used by the [Southern Hive](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink"). When tied up
on a pole a character can medic themselves (Provided the job is set)
once their legs reach a certain threshold. When eaten alive in Kenshi,
cut damage as well as negative bandaged health is applied. You'll need
to patch up that damage or your character will be crippled even with a
full health robotic limb.

**Storage: Steel Bars** is a [Storage](Storage.md "wikilink") container
which exclusively contains [Steel Bars](Steel_Bars.md "wikilink"). Players
can construct this building after researching [Storage Boxes:
Ore](Storage_Boxes:_Ore_(Tech) "wikilink").

This container can hold a total of 25 [](Steel_Bars.md).

## History

![](Storage_Steel_Bars.jpg "Storage_Steel_Bars.jpg")\]\]This storage
container was introduced in version 0.59.1 of Kenshi. Prior to that
update the only way to store steel bars was to place them in a Storage
Chest. This made automation of crafting more difficult because the
player would have had to micromanage the input of steel bars or rely on
the slow production of a [Steel Refinery](Steel_Refinery.md "wikilink").
Initially the description for Storage: Steel Bars was the same as for
the [Storage: Ore](Storage:_Ore "wikilink"). As of version 0.59.1 there
was no maximum capacity of steel bars that could be stored, but it was
introduced later.

A **Flesh Cleaver** is a [Hacker Class](Hacker.md "wikilink") weapon, with
a decent balance between Cutting and Stun [Damage](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Damage.md "wikilink"),
and a lower than normal Bleed Rate. It is the preferred weapon of
[Cannibals](Cannibal.md "wikilink") and the [](Shrieking_Bandits.md). The Flesh Cleaver is tied with
the [Wakizashi](Wakizashi.md "wikilink") for having the shortest reach of
all weapons.

This weapon has inventory dimensions of 2x8, meaning it can only be used
as a primary weapon.

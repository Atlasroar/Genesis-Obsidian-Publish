The **United Cities** (A.K.A. "**The Empire**") is a feudalistic slaver
society that controls large portions of land across the continent, most
notably within the Great Desert and its surrounding regions as well as
having a southern enclave encompassing Kenshi's southwestern coastline.
Ruled by [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink"), they are a highly
corrupt empire and monetary worth is the prime measure of a person in
their culture. So much so, that being poor and hungry can get you
arrested. The drug [Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink") is illegal, and the
samurai guards are obsessed with purging it from their streets, to such
an extent that even the material used to produce it,
[Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink"), is also outlawed.

[Slavery](Slavery.md "wikilink") and [serfdom](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md "wikilink")
are important pillars of their empire, providing food and material.
Anti-slavery ideologies are considered extremist perspectives and
treated as a form of terrorism. Another pillar is the [](Traders_Guild.md). The guild brings their cities great
wealth and prosperity. They have advanced technologies, higher quality
equipment, and valuable luxuries imported from distant lands.

Though the United Cities is quite diverse, there is also a great deal of
racial stratification. The nobility is mostly comprised of
[Humans](Human.md "wikilink") (especially
[Scorchlanders](Scorchlander.md "wikilink")) and [Sheks](Shek.md "wikilink"),
while [Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink") are disproportionately more likely to be
peasants. Non-humans in general are derided in UC
[newspapers](United_Weekly_Series.md "wikilink"), and are at risk from
being attacked by roaming vigilante mobs known as [](United_Heroes_League.md). [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md) are often found in the Empire's
locations and areas.

The Empire is ruled by the [Noble Circle](Noble_Circle.md "wikilink"), a
cabal of extremely narcissistic, cruel, and entitled lords and ladies.
They are known for hunting peasants for sport, making outlandish
requests to their guards (such as ordering them to train a pet
[Leviathan](Leviathan.md "wikilink")), and generally lacking concern for
the lives of anyone beneath them.

[Samurai](Samurai.md "wikilink") are the leading military and [](Samurai_Police.md) of the United Cities.

The United Cities does not tolerate Hemp and Hemp-related goods and
production facilities. Owning any building such as [](Biofuel_Distillery_(Hemp).md), [](Hemp_Farm.md), [Hemp Processor](Hemp_Processor.md "wikilink")
or a [Hydroponic Hemp](Hydroponic_Hemp.md "wikilink") will result in a
[Drug Bust](Drug_Bust.md "wikilink") raid against the player if this
building is discovered by the authorities. It is likewise illegal to
possess or import [Bloodrum](Bloodrum.md "wikilink"),
[Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink") or [Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink") into the
Empire, despite evidence of use and possession of said substances by the
Nobles. One rule for them and another for anybody else is very much what
the Empire stands on.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

### Player Relations

*The reasons for this faction to have a non-zero relation towards you.*

- If you start as the[](Game_Starts.md#Son_of_a_Captain) character, your
  father was a former soldier in their army. This makes them very
  favorable to you.
- Turning in Bounties will give a slight increase (+2) in relations.
  - Common Bounties on Outlaw Farmers, Sand ninjas

## Locations

## Trivia

- Settling within or near United Cities territory will result in a tax
  collector coming by weekly. They will demand 3,000 cats from you. If
  you lack funds, the tax collector will insult you for being poor, then
  remind you that being poor is a crime. You have three days before they
  return - if you don't cough up enough cash they will attack.
  - You can avoid paying taxes entirely if you are allied with them. To
    get to 50 relations, you would have to pay 100,000 cats, or hand in
    25 [bounties](Bounty.md "wikilink"). This may be a more expensive
    option, but it will safeguard you from ever being caught at a bad
    time. Another thing is that if you are allied with the Empire, they
    will send reinforcements to your outpost whenever you are attacked.
- It's likely that interracial marriages between Greenlanders and
  Scorchlanders are fairly common with in UC, given the almost equal
  ratio of their presence in UC alongside the fact that several unique
  characters (like [Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink")) are
  "light-skinned" Scorchlanders.

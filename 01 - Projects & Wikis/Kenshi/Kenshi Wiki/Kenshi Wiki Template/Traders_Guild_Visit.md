**Traders Guild Visit** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can
trigger if the player lives within 5,000 meters of [](Trader's_Edge.md). It cannot trigger if the player is an
ally of the [Anti-Slavers](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Anti-Slavers.md "wikilink") or [](Traders_Guild.md), an enemy of the
[Hounds](Hounds.md "wikilink"), or if [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") or [](Lady_Kana.md) have been killed or captured.

If the conditions have been met, the event will have a 50% chance to
trigger if the player's base is within 3,000 meters of [](Trader's_Edge.md), this chance will scale down with
distance until it hits 0% chance at 5,000 meters.

Once triggered the [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink") will send a
campaign to the player's base. This campaign will consist of two squads,
each made up of 4 [Samurai Captains](Samurai_Captain.md "wikilink"), and
led by a [TG Diplomat](TG_Diplomat "wikilink").

When the campaign arrives, the leader will demand the player come speak
with them or face repercussions. If ignored, a [](Thug_Attack.md) event will be triggered in 90-150 hours.

If spoken to, the leader will demand the player either go to [](Trader's_Edge.md) and speak to [Yamdu](Yamdu.md "wikilink")
to purchase a permanent membership in the [](Traders_Guild.md), or to pay a weekly fee of 4,000 cats.
Accepting to pay will result in another **Traders Guild Visit** event
triggering in 75-120 hours to collect the first payment, unless you
purchase the permanent membership from [Yamdu](Yamdu.md "wikilink") before
they arrive. Refusal to pay will result in a [](Thug_Attack.md) event triggering in 72-120 hours, while
threatening the diplomat instead will result in it triggering in 36-60
hours.

Amusingly, there are no loss triggers on the event. Because of this, if
a player were to kill the diplomat and his squad before they arrive at
the player's base, no future demands for payment will trigger, nor will
there be any hostile retaliations except for the loss of relation
points. This can get you a permanent tax exemption without paying for
it, and with no major consequences.

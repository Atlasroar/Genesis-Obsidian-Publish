A **Hive Village** is a minor location controlled by the [](Western_Hive.md). Currently there are 5 villages located
in [Vain](Vain.md "wikilink") as well as three in [Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink").

Hive Villages in Vain are often attacked by [](Beak_Thing.md) and [Gorillos](Gorillo.md "wikilink").
Players who are being pursued by these animals can go into Villages for
protection. However, since the Hive is not an ally of the player, hivers
will only enter the fight if the animal attacks a drone as well.

Hive villagers don't trade with player's hive characters because they
are considered 'hiveless'. So, to trade with the hive, players must have
a character of another race ([Human](Human.md "wikilink"),
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink"), or [Shek](Shek.md "wikilink")). Hive
Traders will not sell goods to any member of the player faction if they
find out that there is a hiveless character in the player's squad.

### Village Inhabitants

Worker drones act as labourers: cooking, mining, sleeping etc. They
don't have any [Weapons](Weapons.md "wikilink"). Therefore, they try to
flee if they face an enemy. However, if there are no more soldier drones
around, workers can steal weapons from player's unconscious characters
and try to fight the enemy.

Hive traders are princes and act as usual traders. They don't sleep and
can fight.

Soldier drones act in two ways: as town guards and as shop guards. Town
guards fight with enemies to defend the village while shop guards will
fight only to protect their shop and hive trader. In their free time,
town guards patrol town and sleep. Shop guards do not leave their shops.
All soldier drones are armed with unknown grade [](Flesh_Cleaver.md), [](Rag_Loincloth.md) and [](Basic_First_Aid_Kit.md).

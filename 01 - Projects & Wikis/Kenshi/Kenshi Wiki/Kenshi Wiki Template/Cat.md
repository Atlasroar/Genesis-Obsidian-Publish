**Cat** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink") who is a
little unhinged. He's a decent medic, but currently a prisoner of the
[Dust King](Dust_King.md "wikilink") in his
[Tower](Dust_King_Tower.md "wikilink"). He has a Dumb
[Personality](Personality.md "wikilink").

## Backstory

A [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") citizen, Cat was dressed
very nicely on his way to a date when he was mistaken for a rich person
because of his nice clothes. He got caught by the [](Dust_Bandits.md). They wanted a ransom for him because
they thought he was someone important, but no one showed up so he was
left in prison in the [Dust King Tower](Dust_King_Tower.md "wikilink"). The
[UC](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") nobles don't even know him.

## Trivia

A bug existed in some [game versions](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Changelog.md "wikilink") prior to the
1.0 release that prevented unique prisoners like [Agnu](Agnu.md "wikilink")
and Cat to spawn if the game was imported in the past. Importing again
without "Dead NPCs" fixed the problem.

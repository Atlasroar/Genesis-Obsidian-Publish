**Fishmen**, also known as **Gurglers**, are fishlike abominations who
live on an island south of [Catun](Catun.md "wikilink") called [](Fishman_Island.md). Their leader, [](King_Gurgler.md), can be found in the south-westernmost
corner of the island in the [Island Lab](Island_Lab.md "wikilink").
**Fishmen** control and infest the ruins of the city [](Fish_Isle.md) which is located in the center of the
island.

Despite being relatively weak on their own, they should not be
underestimated when in large numbers (much akin to
[Fogmen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink")).

Gurglers presumably hatch from [Gurgler Eggs](Gurgler_Egg.md "wikilink")
and sleep in Fish Beds.

## Trivia

- In the [FCS](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md "wikilink"), aside from the
  racial groups Fishman and Alpha Fishman, there is an unused racial
  group called King Fishman. Most likely this was intended to be used
  for the King Gurgler, but was discarded in favor of making the
  character an Alpha Fishman.
- There is an issue in Kenshi where, when fighting Fishmen you sometimes
  are able to severe limbs which immediately become invisible. The
  following mod, **[Fishsticks - Gurgler Limb
  Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1752014748)**,
  fixes this issue.

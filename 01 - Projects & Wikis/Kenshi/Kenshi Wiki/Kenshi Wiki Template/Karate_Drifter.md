**Karate Drifters**are members of the [Drifters](Drifters.md "wikilink").
They are very powerful mysterious martial artists who can be rarely
found wandering alone in [Stobe's Gamble](Stobe's_Gamble.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- Given their great combat skills in Martial Arts, and the fact that
  Drifters have a positive relationship with Anti-Slavers, as well as
  the fact that they spawn exclusively in the zone where Anti-Slavers HQ
  is located. It's possible that these people may have gotten their
  training from the Anti-Slavers, and/or Anti-Slaver wannabes training
  their skills on the battlefield.

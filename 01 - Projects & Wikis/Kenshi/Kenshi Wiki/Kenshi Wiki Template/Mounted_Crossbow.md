**Mounted Crossbows** were added to the game and are a type of defensive
turrets. They can be built on the ground or on top of [](Defensive_Walls.md). By researching [](Crossbow_Turret_Strings_(Tech).md) and [](Composite_Runners.md) you can increase the power of
Mounted Crossbows.

The range, damage, accuracy, and speed of a turret is modified by the
operator's related skills as well as the height difference between the
turret and its target. Turrets will be more effective if fired from
above.

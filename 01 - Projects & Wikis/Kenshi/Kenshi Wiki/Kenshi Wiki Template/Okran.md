Serving as the undeniable, rightful and most important figure of the
[Holy Nation](Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") and its religious practices, Okran
is the deity that every man, woman and child worship and give their life
to. He is regarded as the flame, the light, the shining radiance in a
world of evil and heresy.

Okran was said to be originated from Chitrin, a deity who was said to be
a great being who sacrificed himself in order to save the planet
(according to [Book of Sacrifice](Book_Of_Sacrifice.md "wikilink")), in
doing so he split his very being into two forms, one of light (Okran)
and one of darkness ([Narko](Narko.md "wikilink")). After that, according
to HN scriptures and priests, Okran then cast his dark counterpart - who
had once resided within his own being - down into the underworld, whilst
he himself remained the protector and guardian of the topside of the
land. It is written within the holy scriptures that
[Narko](Narko.md "wikilink") exists in a place without light, and that she
uses her darkness to corrupt and bribe the souls of mortals into sin and
heresy.

This ancient doctrine of belief is one of the primary reasons women are
shunned within [Holy Nation](Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") society, as Okran
is seen as a male figure, whilst [Narko](Narko.md "wikilink") (who he
ripped from the dark recesses of himself) was regarded as female and
evil. It also gives insight into where the primary values of the [](Holy_Nation.md) originated, those of fighting the
darkness both within oneself and out in the world, as well as the belief
that through enslavement and hard labor an individual can begin to seek
redemption in the eyes of Okran.

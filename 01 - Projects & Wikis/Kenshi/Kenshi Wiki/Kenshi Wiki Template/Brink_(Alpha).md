Brink is the starting town in which you spawn, and is owned by [](Imperial_Lords.md). It is located on a large hill, in the
northern half of the map. Nearby towns include
[Catun](Catun_(Alpha).md "wikilink"), [Shark](Shark_(Alpha).md "wikilink"),
and [Trader's Edge](Trader's_Edge_(Alpha).md "wikilink") as well as an
outpost to the North east.

You spawn near the front gates and a Bar. This is where most players
will pick up their first party member.

[Brink](Brink.md "wikilink") made it into the final release of the game as
a settlement of the [United Cities](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink").

**Public Sales** is [Core Tech](Core_Tech.md "wikilink") which allows
players to construct [Shop Counters](Shop_Counter.md "wikilink").

Players who are interested in making some money through trading should
complete this research. However, characters will only buy items which
are on their [shopping list](NPC_Shopping_Behavior.md "wikilink"), making
this only a reliable way to sell vices and first aid kits.

An Outhouse is a [building](Buildings_List.md "wikilink") type available
from the "Buildings" category of the Build Menu. It requires 1 [](Building_Materials.md) to construct and has to be
placed outside as it is still a type of building (a slight hint may be
found its name). It allows your character to sit in it (by assigning a
"worker" to it), presumably acting like any other chair in the game -
reducing the hunger rate of said character. It is researched with a
[Random Furniture](Blueprints.md#Furniture_Blueprints "wikilink")
blueprint.

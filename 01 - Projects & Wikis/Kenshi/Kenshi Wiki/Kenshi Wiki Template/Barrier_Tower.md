**Barrier Tower** has many [](Upgraded_Watchbot.md) Skeletons manning [](Harpoon_Turret.md) Mk2. Inside the tower there are
[Beds](Bed.md "wikilink") that are not marked as private, meaning they are
free to use, the bed in the middle has a table in the way, but you can
still sleep in it by clicking on it while standing on the stairs above
it. The Watchbot skeletons can often have and grade [](Eagle's_Cross.md).

Interestingly, this outpost has walls blocking an easy passage to use
the side of Sonorous Dark to get an easy route to
[Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink").

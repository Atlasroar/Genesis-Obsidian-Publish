**Black Desert Ninjas** is the faction of the [](Cloud_Ninja.md). They can be encountered all over the
Deadlands and its nearby regions. Despite this, they're still humans,
and therefore highly vulnerable to the region's lethal weather. As they
have no protection against acid, they tend to be killed by attrition.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

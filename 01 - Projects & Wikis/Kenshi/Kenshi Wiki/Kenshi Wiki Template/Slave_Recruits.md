Aside from speaking to characters in [bars](Generic_Recruits.md "wikilink")
and [specific outposts](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink"), the player is also
able to recruit by buying or rescuing slaves.
![](SlaveRecruits.png "SlaveRecruits.png")

## Buying Slaves

Mostly in [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") territory, the
player is able to purchase slaves from the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md). The purchase is done in a similar way
as with [buying animals](Guide_to_Animals.md "wikilink"). Slaves can either
immediately join the player after being freed or hang around for a while
as "allies" before deciding to do so. However, unlike with animals,
there is a chance of the slave abandoning the player immediately after
purchase, or after some time of traveling together. This chance is lower
with "stock" slaves found at the beginning of the game. Anyone found to
be enslaved as part of the "living world" has a lesser chance to join
the player.

There's a way to recruit some of the non-recruitable characters by
"buying their freedom" after they are enslaved. The irony of this method
is in that it is **the player** that puts them into this terrible
situation and then "rescues" them. Players should pick up
**unconscious** characters, travel to the slavers, and then **drop them
down in front of the slavers** so that they'd enslave them. After it is
done, it is safe to "rescue" the new slaves by buying their freedom.
Provided that the player characters are not seen by the new slaves prior
to them suddenly appearing in a slave cage and with a headache, they
will feel grateful towards the player. Upon being freed, some former
slaves will join the player's party as a form of gratitude. This
strategy has been tested on [](Holy_Nation_Robot.md) for example.

## Rescuing Slaves

The player may attempt to rescue slaves by unlocking their
[cages](Prisoner_Cage.md "wikilink") and
[shackles](Prisoner_Shackles.md "wikilink"). Once successful, the freed
slave may follow the player for some time and then join or abandon the
player after some distance. On the map these slaves will be displayed as
a green "ally" dot similar to bodyguards and ally reinforcements for
[Events](Events.md "wikilink").

Slaves may sometimes be found wandering the map with their masters. This
is true with [Noble Hunters](Noble_Hunter.md "wikilink") and
[Reaver](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Reavers.md "wikilink") bands, the latter owning a special type of
slave known as a [Reaver Slave](Reaver_Slave.md "wikilink"). Freeing these
slaves can also lead to potential recruitment, however one will most
likely need to fight both the squad and the slaves themselves first, as
their handlers can and will order these slaves to attack the player.
This is always true for [Reaver Slaves](Reaver_Slave.md "wikilink"), as
their masters must be defeated in order for them to be recruited.

Some sources
([here](https://steamcommunity.com/app/233860/discussions/0/1733217429056700227/)
and
[here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kenshi/comments/b5jzlr/after_about_2_days_of_savescumming_and_glitching/))
indicate, that:

- Characters that do not pass the '[](Playable_Characters.md#'Is_Recruitable'_Tag)'
  condition cannot be recruited.
- Characters sold into slavery or placed into cages by the player can
  not be recruited via liberation.
- Characters which were fought by the player may have difficulty at
  being recruited.
- It is possible to recruit a character via liberation after performing
  Assasination KO on it.
- Chance of recruitment depends of character's "personality" (another
  internal game classification of NPCs), with some personalities being
  unrecruitable.
  - If liberated, Dumb or Fearful slaves will prefer staying in their
    cages.
  - If liberated, Brave and Traitorous slaves will run away.
  - If liberated, Honorable and Smart slaves will follow the player and
    may join.
  - A bug currently causes Maniacal slaves to have a positive reaction
    to freedom, but still stay in their cages similar to Dumb or Fearful
    slaves.
  - Traitorous slaves will always run away when bought.

<!-- -->

- Some characters can not be recruited (ever, even if they would pass
  DC_IS_RECRUITABLE check) due to not being assigned a dialogue package,
  or due to being assigned a dialogue package without recruitment
  possibilities.

Dialogue definitions in FCS also have related dialogues defined "for
enemies = false", so if the character is enemy, recruitment would seem
to be impossible. Making character non-enemy may involve allying with
character's faction or allying with the character personally, and may
involve saving and loading the game. Usually unlocking character's
shackles, cage or buying him from slavery marks the character as
"temporary ally", which is sufficient for dialogues to trigger.

## Locations

Slaves can be found and rescued or purchased from these locations:

- [Eyesocket](Eyesocket.md "wikilink")
- [Port North](Port_North.md "wikilink")

<!-- -->

- [Port South](Port_South.md "wikilink")
- [Slave Farm](Slave_Farm.md "wikilink")
- [Slave Farm South](Slave_Farm_South.md "wikilink")
- [Slave Markets](Slave_Markets.md "wikilink")
- [South Stone Camp](South_Stone_Camp.md "wikilink")
- [Stone Camp](Stone_Camp.md "wikilink")
- Any United City that spawns a [Slave Shop](Slave_Shop.md "wikilink").

[The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") enslaves many characters
for religious purposes and because of this they do not sell slaves to
players. Slaves can be found and rescued from these locations:

- [Holy Mines](Holy_Mines.md "wikilink")
- [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink")

Characters imprisoned by police will likely also ally with players if
they are freed from their cage and shackles. Due to this, there is a
potential of recruiting characters this way from any [](Major_Towns.md).

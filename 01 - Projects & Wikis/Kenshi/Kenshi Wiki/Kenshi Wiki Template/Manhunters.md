**Manhunters**are a [Faction](Factions.md "wikilink") of people who hunt
people who escaped [Slavery](Slavery.md "wikilink") for a living, similar
to the [Slave Hunters](Slave_Hunters.md "wikilink") faction.

They can often be found in areas with lots of escaped slaves around, and
will sometimes attack innocents (including the player) and sell them to
the slavers as "escaped slaves".

Manhunters which encounter the player will question among themselves
whether nearby Player Characters look a bit like a slave regardless of
the situation and ask themselves if they're worth taking. Depending on
how many other characters are around, the Manhunters might attack the
player's squad.

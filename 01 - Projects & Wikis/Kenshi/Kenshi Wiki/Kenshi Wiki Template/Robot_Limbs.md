**\*The tip incorrectly mentions "sharp weapon". If you are hit by any
attack whatsoever and your limb goes below -100% of it's max health from
that attack the limb will be
severed\***![](Skeleton-Arm.png "Skeleton-Arm.png") **Robot Limbs** are
replacements for [missing limbs](Severed_Limbs.md "wikilink"). They come in
many variants and give bonuses and penalties to certain skills. The
boost can be so desirable that players may make their squad members lose
limbs on purpose so robot limbs can be installed. One way to lose limbs
is through the use of the [Peeler Machine](Peeler_Machine.md "wikilink").
Please note that Unarmed Damage Bonus does not actually work as of
v1.0.55.

Whenever a character is missing any natural limbs, the 'Limbs' button in
the inventory window becomes usable and prosthetics can be installed the
same way weapons and armor are equipped. (Once installed, robot limbs no
longer count toward [Encumbrance](Encumbrance.md "wikilink")). All
characters, including [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink"), need to lose
their natural limbs through trauma before Robot Limbs can be used. When
a limb is lost a character receives 0.2 bleeding and 0.002 "steady
bleeding" for every cut damage (and negative bandaged health) on the
limb. Steady bleeding will not stop until bandaged or it can be stopped
instantly by putting a robotic limb in the place of the lost limb.
Animals cannot lose limbs or use prosthetics.

Robot Limbs need to be maintained in the same way Skeletons maintain
themselves. Cut damage can be fixed on the spot with a [](Robotics_Repair_Kit.md). The "wear and tear damage" that
builds up over time (4% of total damage taken is applied as wear damage)
and decreases the max health of a limb can be fixed using a [](Skeleton_Repair_Bed.md). These Repair Beds can be
typically found in locations which sell limbs and usually require
payment the same way a bar bed does.

Characters can get in trouble in [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) when having Robot Limbs. They will
be seen as no better than Skeletons and attacked unless the Holy Nation
[faction reputation](Guide_to_Faction_Relations.md "wikilink") is 50 or
higher. Even if the reputation is 50 or higher, a character wearing
robotic limbs will be unable to interact with [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) and any other member of the Holy
Nation including [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), [](Holy_Priest.md) and Shopkeepers. The Holy Nation trade
caravans who patrol around can still be traded with even without allying
with their faction.

## Crafting

![](robocraft.png "robocraft.png") Players can craft robotic limbs on a
[Skeleton Limb Bench](Skeleton_Limb_Bench.md "wikilink") and needed
components on a [Robotics Bench](Robotics_Bench.md "wikilink"). Unlike with
weapon and armor, there are no [Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink") for
limbs. New crafting options are unlocked by doing research in the
[Crafting Tech](Crafting_Tech.md "wikilink") tree instead. Economy limb
research becomes available at tech level 4, Skeleton limbs at tech level
5 and the rest at tech level 6. All robotic limbs are craftable except
for the Steady and Thief's arms.

What quality a crafted limb will be is determined by the crafter's
[Robotics](Robotics.md "wikilink") skill. It's the same skill that is
trained by using repair kits and by crafting any components at the
Robotics Bench. There is also an element of chance, and the quality can
suffer when the crafter is not physically well or working in low light
conditions. Unlike a weapon or armor smith, a robotics crafter can
attain a skill level at which all products will be max quality. The
better limbs require a somewhat complicated crafting procedure when
constructed from raw materials. Players crafting in a bought house may
simply opt to buy the [](Robotics_Components.md), greatly reducing the fuss.

## Locations

Robotic limbs are sold at the following vendors:

- [Hive Robotics Shop](Hive_Robotics_Shop.md "wikilink")
- [Mongrel Robotics Workshop](Mongrel_Robotics_Workshop.md "wikilink")
- [Robotics Shop](Robotics_Shop.md "wikilink")
- [Robotics Workshop](Robotics_Workshop.md "wikilink")
- [Travel and Repairs Shop](Travel_and_Repairs_Shop.md "wikilink")

[Hive](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") shops specialize in the cheap economy
limbs while the others, usually run by [Skeletons](Skeleton.md "wikilink"),
have more higher quality merchandise. An exceptionally large selection
of high-quality limbs can be found at the [](Black_Desert_City.md) Robotics Shop.

Robotic limbs can also randomly spawn through the
[Artifacts](Artifacts.md "wikilink") system in locations which have a gear
artifacts value.

## Tips

- Installing an artificial limb on a downed enemy will later open up an
  option to [heal](Field_Medic.md "wikilink") that enemy if they were to
  get hurt again. This option is normally not available for conscious
  enemies.
- An exploit that can be abused to heal all damage (Including wear) on a
  robotic limb is to take off the limb, save your game and then load the
  save. When the limb is put back on it will be back at full health.

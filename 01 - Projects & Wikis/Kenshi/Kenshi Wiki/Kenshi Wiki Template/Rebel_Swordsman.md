**Rebel Swordsmen**are members of the [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Rebel_Swordsmen.md) faction. They appear as guards
and patrols of towns fully controlled by [](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Empire_Peasants.md) in the northeastern territories.

If the local noble of a town is killed but [](Emperor_Tengu.md) is still alive(conditions vary by
town), then Rebel Swordsmen along with [](Outlaw_Farmer.md) show up in force to assault the town
and potentially occupy it if they overrun the defenders.

They have a 10% chance to spawn with a bounty ranging from 300 - 1300
Cats.

**Holy Mines** are a series of similar [](Minor_Outposts.md) located in territory owned by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). They are mining operations
that utilize [slave](Slavery.md "wikilink") labor, managed by [](High_Overseer.md) of the Holy Nation. Player can
discover their location by reading the **Glorious Holy
[Map](Maps.md "wikilink")**.

There are in total 5 Holy Mines, 3 are located in [](Skinner's_Roam.md) while the other 2 are located in
[Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink").

[Lower Servants](Lower_Servant.md "wikilink"), as well as any enemies
captured from the surrounding area like bandits, are kept caged in
[Slave Shops](Slave_Shop.md "wikilink") during the night, and are made to
go to work during the day. However, it should be noted that the player
is not able to buy or sell slaves in this location.

Holy Mines are protected by [Holy Sentinels](Holy_Sentinel.md "wikilink")
and [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), who serve as guards and slave
drivers. [Slavers](Slaver.md "wikilink") aligned with the Holy Nation can
be found at the Holy Mines as well, presumably hired as extra help.

## Town overrides

[Holy Mines](Holy_Mines.md "wikilink") can be affected by multiple [](World_States.md) to produce the following [](Town_Overrides.md).

<tabview> Holy Mines/Destroyed \| Destroyed Holy Mines/Shek Kingdom \|
Shek Kingdom Holy Mines/Kral's Chosen \| Kral's Chosen Holy Mines/Slave
Traders \| Slave Traders </tabview>

## Tips

- With stealth and [Assassination](Assassination.md "wikilink") of around
  50, holy mines can be cleared by knocking out and kidnapping those
  within one by one.
- Players should be careful, as characters that end up knocked out near
  the gates may be enslaved by the resident overseer.

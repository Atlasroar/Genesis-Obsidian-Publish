**Storage: Chainmail** is a [Storage](Storage.md "wikilink") container
which exclusively contains [](Chainmail_Sheets.md). Players can construct this
building after researching [Storage Boxes:
Crafting](Storage_Boxes:_Crafting "wikilink"). It is the only type of
storage of industrial materials that must be placed **inside** a
building. This is perhaps an oversight or a tribute to the delicate
nature of the chainmail.

This container can hold a total of 25 [](Chainmail_Sheets.md).

## History

This storage container was introduced in version 0.67.0. It shares the
exact same model in-game as [Storage: Armour
Plate](Storage:_Armour_Plate "wikilink"). When it was added, [Storage:
Leather](Storage:_Leather "wikilink") also shared the same model.

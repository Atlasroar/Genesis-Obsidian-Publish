**Hydroponic Wheatstraw**is a [Hydroponics](Hydroponics.md "wikilink") bay
which grows [Wheat](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink"). It can be constructed after
researching [Hydroponic Wheatstraw](Hydroponics_(Tech).md "wikilink"). This
building uses and levels characters' [Farming](Farming.md "wikilink") stat.
It requires inputs of [Power](Power.md "wikilink") (10 used)
and [Water](Water.md "wikilink") to grow.

Despite being an "indoor only" placement,
[Hydroponics](Hydroponics.md "wikilink") can be placed on the roofs of
buildings.

Compared to normal wheat farms, output seems low at first glance.
However, as each plant produces 2 crops on harvesting, potential output
is doubled. Maturation time is less than in a normal farm, so output per
in game time gets to roughly half of an XL farm. More important,
harvesting is much quicker for the Hydroponic, combined with less
plants/more yield per plant, this results in a highly more efficient
labour/output relationship, so are definitely recommendable for
mid/end-game, if power is not a significant bottleneck. If
Generators/Biofuel has to be used to power them, efficiency might be
inferior, but no testing is done for this so far.

  harvesting)

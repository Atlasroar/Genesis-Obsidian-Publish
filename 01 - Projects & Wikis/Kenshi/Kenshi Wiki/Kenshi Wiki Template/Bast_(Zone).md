**Bast** is a zone named after a now abandoned outpost of the United
Cities in the northeast region of the map.

[The Holy Nation](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") and the [](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) continue frequent battles in the
region surrounding the former settlement of Bast. While the city itself
has no loot, the surrounding area witnesses many battle scenes where
battles occur in the immediate region surrounding Bast, primarily to the
South.

It's unclear which of the 2 giants are more frequent the victor in
battle due to contradicting evidence, so it's best to keep an eye out if
you are either a non-human or a poor/starving person, as **The Holy
Nation** and **United Cities** have a tendency to target these types of
wanderers, respectively.

## Tips

- Holy Nation sentinel and United City samurai gear, as well as [](Medical_Items.md), can be obtained in
  abundance here. Wearing faction armour works as a
  [Disguise](Disguise.md "wikilink") and may lead to being attacked by
  enemies of that faction or the faction itself if the disguise is
  blown. Faction armour also have their market value significantly
  reduced, making it less profitable than typical armours to sell.

## Trivia

- Dialogue from Bard implies that Bast was colonized in relatively
  recent times, and may have started to prosper, before the Holy
  Nation's invasion.

![](Kenshijobswindow.jpg "Kenshijobswindow.jpg") **Jobs** are an ordered
set of commands that are given by holding Shift and Right-clicking on a
task. Characters with the Jobs button enabled will attempt to do the
jobs starting from the top of the list. If one job cannot be completed,
the character will move to the next one. If a higher-priority job
becomes available again, they will usually abandon their current job to
address it.

### Types of Jobs

These are the categories which jobs fall under:

- First Aid: this includes the Medic and Robotics jobs. They can be
  added through the medic button or when clicking to heal a character.
  These jobs remain active even when Jobs has been deselected for that
  character.
- Work: this includes all jobs where a character is using a machine or
  farm.
- Auto-Haul: when characters have these jobs active, they will carry
  items to the related [Storage](Storage.md "wikilink") building.
  Characters take these items from either their inventory or the
  building which generates it.
- Collection: players can give characters the job of finding dead bodies
  in order to bring them to a [](Corpse_Furnace.md) as well as the job of looting the
  bodies of fallen Animals.

### Mechanics

- Jobs can be re-ordered by dragging and dropping. The job you drag onto
  and everything below it will be pushed down.
- The Jobs list will be cleared upon becoming a
  [slave](Slavery.md "wikilink") and you will be given the Obedient Slave
  job instead.
- Some jobs, like Medic and [Turret](Turrets.md "wikilink") jobs, will be
  given priority whenever a viable target is found, regardless of their
  position on the list. These jobs will only stop after being removed
  from the character's list entirely.
- Jobs for outpost-related things like mining and machinery will be
  ignored once the character gets too far from the outpost the job was
  issued for. Eventually the description of the job in the window will
  become simplified and it might not be restored when the character
  returns.

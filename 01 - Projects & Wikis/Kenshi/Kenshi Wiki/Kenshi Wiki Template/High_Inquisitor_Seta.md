**High Inquisitor Seta** is a member of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) and its
[Inquisition](Inquisitor.md "wikilink"), and an important governor and
military commander for the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md). He can be captured and turned
over to the [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink"), [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md), or [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md) for a sizeable
[Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") of 40,000 Cats.

He is likely to be both the governor of **[Stack](Stack.md "wikilink")**
and **[Bad Teeth](Bad_Teeth.md "wikilink")**, responsible for keeping the
southern cities in order and for commanding the Holy Army against the
[Shek](Shek.md "wikilink").

He is normally located in [Stack](Stack.md "wikilink"), but can also lead
an attack against the player in an event called the [](Wrath_of_God.md).

Players wishing to [destroy the Holy Nation](World_States.md "wikilink")
will need to defeat this character, as well as two others; [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md), and the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) himself.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction. The color used is "Holy Nation Level 3"

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If High Inquisitor Seta is killed/imprisoned there are several World
States that will trigger.

[Stack](Stack.md "wikilink") and [Bad Teeth](Bad_Teeth.md "wikilink") would
fall under [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") rule if
[Esata](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md "wikilink") is alive and free, if Esata is
killed/imprisoned while [Flying Bull](Flying_Bull.md "wikilink") is alive
and free it would fall under [Kral's Chosen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md "wikilink")
rule instead. If Flying Bull is also killed/imprisoned as well both of
them would remain under The Holy Nation rule if Holy Lord Phoenix is
alive and free (and it wasn't takenover by them beforehand), or else it
will fall into ruins under The Holy Nation faction.

High Inquisitor Seta's death/imprisonment can also contribute to a World
State of [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") taking over which
would include High Inquisitor Valtena's death/imprisonment while both
[Emperor Tengu](Emperor_Tengu.md "wikilink") and
[Longen](Longen.md "wikilink") are alive and free.

If High Inquisitor Seta, Holy Lord Phoenix and High Inquisitor Valtena
are all either killed/imprisoned while [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") is alive
and free, [Flotsam Ninjas](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") will take
over [](Blister_Hill.md) and [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink"). If
Moll is also killed/imprisoned, both towns would fall under the control
of [Holy Nation Outlaws](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md "wikilink").

If Esata is alive and free while High Inquisitor Seta is
killed/imprisoned, [Hundred Guardians](Hundred_Guardian.md "wikilink") and
[Shek Warriors](Shek_Warrior.md "wikilink") patrol will start spawning at
[Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink"), [](Okran's_Gulf.md) and [](Okran's_Pride.md) regions.

If [Ghost](Ghost.md "wikilink") is alive and free while High Inquisitor
Seta is killed/imprisoned it will cause
[Berserkers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink") patrols start spawning in [](Okran's_Gulf.md) region.

If Flying Bull is alive and free while High Inquisitor Seta is
killed/imprisoned it will cause Kral's Chosen patrols to start spawning
in [Border Zone](Border_Zone.md "wikilink"), [](Skinner's_Roam.md), [](Okran's_Gulf.md) and [](Okran's_Pride.md) regions. Further increasing if Holy
Lord Phoenix is also killed/imprisoned. If High Inquisitor Seta, Holy
Lord Phoenix and High Inquisitor Valtena are all killed/imprisoned
Kral's Chosen patrols will start spawning at [](Okran's_Valley.md) and [Skimsands](Skimsands.md "wikilink")
regions.

If High Inquisitor Seta and High Inquisitor Valtena are either
killed/imprisoned while [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") is alive and free,
[Flotsam Ninjas](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") patrols would start spawning
in [Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink") and [](Okran's_Valley.md) region.

His death/imprisonment also causes the Holy army patrols become less
frequent in [Okran's Pride](Okran's_Pride.md "wikilink") and [](Okran's_Gulf.md) regions.

If High Inquisitor Seta is killed/imprisoned alongside with Holy Lord
Phoenix and High Inquisitor Valtena, the Holy army would cripple and
cease to spawn and be replaced with [](Strayed_Paladin.md) patrol consisted of 4 to 10
people patrolling the following zones: [Bast](Bast.md "wikilink"), [](Border_Zone.md), [Dreg](Dreg.md "wikilink"), [](Okran's_Gulf.md), [](Okran's_Pride.md), [](Okran's_Valley.md), and [](Skinner's_Roam.md).

## Trivia

- Despite being at war with the UC who produces
  [Catun](Catun_Scrapmasters.md "wikilink")-grade weapons, **High
  Inquisitor Seta** appears to have a **Catun**-grade [](Paladin's_Cross.md) (which may make sense if they
  traded it through [Traders Guild](Traders_Guild.md "wikilink"), which
  unlike UC is neutral towards HN).
- Seta is marked with significantly less (4) faction importance in the
  FCS than the other High Inquisitor, (50) Valtena.

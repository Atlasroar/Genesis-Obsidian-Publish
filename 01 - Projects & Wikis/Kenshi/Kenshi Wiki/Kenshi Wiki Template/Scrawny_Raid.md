**Scrawny Raid** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger if
the [Player](Nameless.md "wikilink") has a
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink") within 4,000 meters of a
[Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") owned location or camp. It has a 15%
chance to trigger if within 2,200 meters, this chance scales down with
distance until it hits 0% at 4,000 meters.

Once triggered, the [Cannibals](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") will send an
assault to the player's base. This assault will consist of usually two
to four squads, though can rarely spawn as many as six if the squads
spawn in small enough sizes, each squad will be made up of 10-35
[Scrawny Cannibals](Scrawny_Cannibal.md "wikilink").

When the assault arrives at the player's base, the War Leader will shout
"Meat!" a number of times, before they start the assault, attacking
gates and characters, and kidnapping fallen characters to return them to
their camp or village where they will eventually be eaten if not
rescued. If the assault is defeated, there is a 15% chance for a
[Cannibal Swarm](Cannibal_Swarm.md "wikilink") event to trigger in 24-96
hours.

Why train your squad members? Watch a group of sand ninjas carve their
way through a hapless mob of hungry bandits and you've got your answer.
Specializing your characters is a great way to make them more effective
at their chosen jobs, as well as enhance their survivability when they
do get into combat.

Unlike other games, the amount of experience needed to level up in
Kenshi does not change depending on the level. Instead, the rate at
which you will gain experience decreases depending on your experience
total. If the base experience of a skill is too low you will not gain
any experience. As the xp amount given will equal 0 before reaching
level 101, no skill can reach that level (With the exception of Field
Medic and Robotics (Which level up based on time spent)) and many cannot
even reach 100.

## Recommended order for training combat skills

If you train up athletics and stealth first, this allows you to avoid
(via speed or hiding) enemies in the wilderness, allowing you to engage
in combat only where it would be beneficial. Next, build Toughness to
reduce all damage taken followed by melee defense by getting hit by
units with high attack. Followed by attack/dexterity by using rusted
junk quality weapons with high cut and low blunt damage.

## Athletics and Swimming

[Athletics](Athletics.md "wikilink") and [Swimming](Swimming.md "wikilink")
are trained in a very intuitive way. Athletics can be trained fastest by
having a character's encumbrance percentage at or close to 0% and
sending them running across the map. When at 0% encumbrance, characters
will gain Athletics XP at 1.5 times their current level's XP rate. After
a certain level, characters should be easily outrunning any hostile
characters and can easily be sent running around without the user
actively watching their location.

Athletics training in groups can be combined with strength training for
an easy and safe training regimen. Reach 70% encumbrance with one
character while carrying another unit, while everyone else at no
encumbrance. The strength character will be at maximum strength training
(50%), and all other characters will move at the same very low speed
despite training at the maximum athletics rate (150%). Now just march
back and forth inside the walls of a large city or your base.

You can train swimming in order to easily escape powerful foes.
Important to note however that your characters will never swim faster
than they can walk. It is suggested to avoid swimming in water in areas
like the [Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink"), [](South_Wetlands.md), and [](The_Swamp.md) as many animals can still attack you while
in the water. Always avoid swimming in acidic water as weather
protections from armour against acid will not decrease the damage taken
from swimming in it. [Hive](Hive.md "wikilink") and
[Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") characters do not have to worry about
Acid and are fine. Skeletons do not have to worry about leveling
swimming at all, no matter their level they will swim at the same
(6.711mph) speed. Note, characters cannot drown. When swimming carry
another unit to double your experience gain. You cannot train strength
while swimming but carry bonus applies to swimming.

## Combat

### Dexterity

Weight actually has nothing to do with XP rate for
[Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink"), despite the description. It's all
based on the ratio of cut to total [Damage](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Damage.md "wikilink") on the
weapon. The more cut relative to total damage, the more Dexterity XP.

Also see "Take Prisoners" in the section about Melee Fighting.

Weapons which will train Dexterity the fastest relative to
Attack/Martial Arts XP are, Martial Arts, [Katanas](Katanas.md "wikilink"),
[Polearms](Polearms.md "wikilink") (except staves), or
[Sabres](Sabres.md "wikilink"). The lower the quality of the weapon the
higher the cut damage will be relative to blunt so using Rusted Junk
quality weapons will result in more experience. To calculate the amount
of Dex experience gain when using a weapon simply take the cut damage
and divide it by the total damage on the weapon:

$\text{Dexterity XP} = \frac{Cut}{Cut+Blunt}$

Then multiply the result by your racial experience modifiers. (Sheks =
0.8x, Scorchlanders = 1.1x, Hive Prince/Worker Drone = 1.2x)

Reloading crossbows and turrets also raises Dexterity, provided you have
enough bolts: it can be an effective way to train Dexterity without
increasing your Melee Attack, please note that leveling Dexterity in
this way is extremely slow and will stop giving you experience before
level 100.

### Martial Arts and Dodge

[Martial Arts](Martial_Arts.md "wikilink") can be a very tedious combat
method to train because characters engaging in 'unarmed combat' can be
injured through their attacker's hits as well as when landing their own
hits. Starting out training Martial Arts against characters who are
wearing anything heavier than [Light Armour](Light_Armour.md "wikilink")
can easily result in a lot of self-inflicted damage taken over the
course of the fight. If available, it is suggested to upgrade to [](Robot_Limbs.md) as they do not take damage from striking
an enemy with Martial Arts.

Damage done while using Martial Arts depends on three skills: Martial
Arts, [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink"), and
[Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink"). Because of this, it may be better to
grind Strength after to increase the number of attacks you can do before
knocking out enemies while training.

As with Melee Fighting skills, the XP rate of Martial Arts and dodge is
connected to whether a character is fighting someone who is better
trained than them. Wearing [Equipment](Equipment.md "wikilink") which
increases Martial Arts stats will result in easier battles but result in
very little experience. The fastest way to train Martial Arts is to wear
armour that reduces your Martial Arts levels while being over
encumbered. Fighting young animals (like crabs in nests) can lead to
very fast levels even in the late game.

Armour which gives Martial Arts stat boosts are: [](Martial_Artist_Bindings.md), [](Gi_Pants.md), [Gi](Gi.md "wikilink"), [](Sleeveless_Dustcoat.md), [](Assassin's_Rags.md), [Ninja Rags](Ninja_Rags.md "wikilink")
and [Armoured Rag Skirt](Armoured_Rag_Skirt.md "wikilink").

Max martial arts boosts are:

- Shirt [Martial Artist Bindings](Martial_Artist_Bindings.md "wikilink") +4
- Chest [Assassin's Rags](Assassin's_Rags.md "wikilink") +6
- Legs [Armoured Rag Skirt](Armoured_Rag_Skirt.md "wikilink") +4

For a potential maximum total of 14. The other armour slots do not
provide any bonuses. You can further increase this by fighting indoors
for another +8, grant a max total of 22.

Max martial arts maluses are:

- Chest [Samurai Armour](Samurai_Armour.md "wikilink") -10
- Legs [Samurai Legplates](Samurai_Legplates.md "wikilink") -10
- Feet [Samurai Boots](Samurai_Boots.md "wikilink") -5
- [Duststorms](Weather_Effects.md "wikilink") -10 (Certain locations have
  weaker Duststorms)
- [Encumbrance](Encumbrance.md "wikilink") -0.8% Martial Arts per 1% (Max
  of -80% for 100% Encumbrance)

For a potential malus total of -25 from armour alone, -10 from weather
as well as -80% from Encumbrance. The other armour slots do not provide
any maluses.

Around 30-40 points your characters should be hitting fairly often and
depending on your [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") and
[Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink") your damage should be fair. Remember
to try and weigh your characters down a bit while fighting to increase
your [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") while you fight.

[Dodge](Dodge.md "wikilink") is trained alongside Martial Arts and will be
trained when hit while unarmed, interacting with something (Sleeping,
lockpicking, bandaging etc...) or while staggered. If characters have
weapons equipped, they will try to use their weapon to block instead of
dodge incoming attacks. An effective and safe method is to lower your
character's dodge stats by wearing specific types of armour (E.g. the
Samurai armour set) that reduce this stat, which will increase the speed
of level gain. Your dodge experience gain will be reduced based off your
encumbrance percent so training strength prior to dodge will be very
useful. (Example; If you had 40% Encumbrance you would only gain 60%
Dodge XP)

### Melee Fighting Leveling Tactics

- *Use light armor* - Early on (until you build up your melee attack and
  defend skills) it makes sense to keep your fighters light - nothing
  but light armor or less, and focus on items that improve skills
  (bandanas, martial arts bindings, ninja or assassin rags, etc). This
  is both because a -1 skill or +1 skill effect means a lot more when
  your base skill is 1 than when it's 50. This has a second benefit: it
  makes them faster and better able to kite enemies (see below).

<!-- -->

- *Fly a kite!* - Kite mobs of slower enemies to build up melee attack.
  Training dummies are useful (sort of) but slow. If you don't mind a
  bit of micromanagement, you can speed this up quite a bit. With one or
  two light fighters selected, attack a bunch of mobs (it'll probably
  work better if you use "attack target" from the right click menu on
  the nearest enemy). When your character(s) squares off against the
  enemy, watch carefully and use pause repeatedly to determine whether
  your character or one of your enemies is going to swing first. If it's
  your character, great. If not, run away just out of range and then
  reengage. Rinse, repeat. This will keep enemies from surrounding you
  and can often allow you to kill large groups of enemies without a
  scratch. Of course, if you make a mistake, you'll probably get mobbed
  and bludgeoned into the sand. But that's good for your toughness
  skill, right?

<!-- -->

- *Take prisoners -* Once you can build prisoner cages, you can build
  training rooms that will help you level up fighters very quickly.
  Build 4 or 5 cages in a house, and fill them with the most skilled
  enemies you can capture on the battlefield. Don't forget to heal them
  before you bring them home, though, so they don't bleed out on the
  way! Once an enemy has recovered (enough), send one fighter into the
  building, close and \*lock\* the door behind them, and then let the
  enemy out. Fight them until one or the other of you falls. If the
  enemy wins, unlock the door and send in the rest of your troops to
  flatten them. Then heal your trainee and the foe and return your
  training "partner" to their cage to rest up (you can also use a bed
  for this, if you're willing to micromanage recovery times). This works
  much better if you give your enemies and yourself weaker weapons
  (rusted junk quality, craft them with a low level weaponsmith skill)
  and the best armor you have. Early on, this can result in a point of
  melee attack or defense and a point or two of skill in your chosen
  weapon every time you win (or a point or two of toughness when you
  lose). Depending on the weapon you use, you will also train Strength
  and/or Dexterity.

#### Training equipment

Train melee attack and defence with equipment that has maluses.

Melee attack max maluses with variants are:

- Head [Tin Can](Tin_Can.md "wikilink") -5, variant [](Samurai_Helmet.md) -4
- Body [Hive Prisoner Shackles](Hive_Prisoner_Shackles.md "wikilink") -15,
  Crab Armour -10, variant [Samurai Armour](Samurai_Armour.md "wikilink")
  -8
- Back [Large Backpack](Large_Backpack.md "wikilink") -10

For a total potential malus of -30.

Melee defence max maluses with variants are:

- Head [Armoured Hood](Armoured_Hood.md "wikilink") -2
- Body [Hive Prisoner Shackles](Hive_Prisoner_Shackles.md "wikilink") -15,
  variant [Armoured Rags](Armoured_Rags.md "wikilink") -5
- Back [Large Backpack](Large_Backpack.md "wikilink") -10

For a total potential malus of -27.

#### High Risk, High Reward

An effective yet high-risk method of raising melee attack and defence
quickly is by lowering your combat skills, taking advantage the
[Stronger Opponent Logic](Stronger_Opponent_Logic.md "wikilink") systems.
This happens when you equip a backpack, various helms or some armours
such as the Holy Chest Plate. By lowering your effective skill levels,
you may be able to drastically increase your bonus exp gained from
fighting "stronger" opponents (up to x6 the normal exp rate for your
level).

It is very important to note though, this does NOT make you level as
fast as the penalized level. Your base exp rate is still based on your
actual level. This only affects the bonus/penalty multipliers that come
from fighting differently skilled opponents.

#### No Risk, High Reward

This method takes advantage of the game's AI system and results in dummy
battles significantly easier than the *Take Prisoners* method. Start by
recruiting someone into your squad, give them the best armor you have, a
weapon with a defense bonus, put them on block then exclude them from
your party. Since they are no longer a member of your faction, you can
attack them. However, their AI does not seem to have a command which
allows them to switch out of block mode, even though they will be in
combat with you. This lets you super overload your characters you want
to train up and beat on someone way over their level with no danger.

*Note:* This method works until you reload a save. After loading, the AI
returns to the default combat mode.

### Ranged Fighting

One governs accuracy and the other is friendly fire. The FF one is only
trained by shooting your friends, if you fail to hit your friends by
accident you get no XP. The Accuracy one is trained simply by aiming, so
fire rate has no effect. Important to note is that characters can aim at
enemies even if they are not in their line of sight. Thus, aiming at an
enemy, which is not in line of sight, without triggering aggro may prove
to be a useful training method. For example: aiming at an enemy mounted
on a turret. A great way to afk train your crossbow skill is to kidnap
an enemy, stop his bleeding and block him off with weapon cabinets. When
he wakes up, he won't be able to move. Take your archers and put them on
"hold", then have them attack the entrapped enemy. They won't have a
direct line of sight on him, so they won't shoot, but their crossbow
skill will go up continuously.

Reloading a crossbow also trains dexterity and is conducted faster with
a higher dexterity skill.

Trained by using a [Training Turret](Training_Turret.md "wikilink") for a
while or simply by starting out on a defensive
[Turret](Turrets.md "wikilink") and firing at enemies.

## Crafting Skills

[Armour Smith](Armour_Smith.md "wikilink"), [](Crossbow_Smith.md), and [](Weapon_Smith.md) are all stats which involve crafting
[Equipment](Equipment.md "wikilink") and can be trained on the related
[Crafting](Crafting.md "wikilink") tables. In the case of [](Armour_Smith.md), experience can also be gained while
creating the materials needed to craft Equipment. Working in darkness
does not have an effect on XP rates, but it will slow down production
speeds. So, letting the trainee work in darkness may get the same amount
of XP while using less ingredients for training.

## Engineer

Training [Engineer](Engineer.md "wikilink") is pretty straightforward. When
building objects, simply have all the individuals you want to gain
Engineer XP work on them. They'll all gain experience quite quickly. You
can also semi-automate this process by shift-right-clicking on a build
project with all your engineers selected before assigning any other
permanent jobs. These characters will then drop whatever they're doing
and rush over whenever an engineering project becomes available.

A method of grinding the Engineer skill is to continually
partially-dismantle (use the right-click option, not the option in the
UI that appears upon object selection) and rebuild a previously fully
constructed player-built object. This works because dismantling and
rebuilding an object will not require more resources but still reward
experience for BOTH dismantling and rebuilding. This does require
micromanaging the object so it never fully becomes dismantled, else the
object will be destroyed and some construction components will be lost,
requiring more to recreate it. This is more easily done on an object
with a high Condition value as you will need to be less attentive in
switching between dismantling and build. It should be noted that the
initial dismantling will take some of the object's Condition away
immediately (usually 1 full Condition point) and can be enough to fully
dismantle some objects with lower Condition amounts.

## Field Medic

The field medic skill allows you to bandage faster. It also allows you
to fully use [Advanced Splint Kits](Advanced_Splint_Kit.md "wikilink") (51
hp) and receive the speed and cost benefits of the top two first aid
kits. The basic [first aid kit](Medical_Items.md "wikilink") is horribly
slow. Even if you advance your medic skill, your speed won't improve
much using the basic kit. Beware head injuries, since they will lower
your field medic skill.

The basic first aid kit does have one benefit-it slows down healing so
you can gain more XP for injuries you heal, since XP points are based on
time spent healing.

Even if you are tempted to train specialized medics, there is a good
argument to be made for spreading out medical training (and first aid
kits) to everyone in the squad because having lots of people healing
simultaneously is generally faster than one specialist running around
healing everybody. Some recruits might have a field medic skill less
than zero! A unit with their field medic skill too low may possibly
apply negative bandaged health. Remember you can heal enemies to train
up this skill, and there's always a reason to heal up allies.

If you have sufficient medical kits and want to boost healing faster,
remember not to limit your healing only to your own squad; you can boost
your healing ability by healing any NPC or animal you find that are
injured. You can use this tactic on hostiles only if they are
unconscious or playing dead since they normally try to fight you,
preventing your healing. Animals are one of the best ways to level field
medic as they have massive health pools and do not have armour.

### Craft Medical Items

Build a [Crafting](Crafting.md "wikilink") table ([](Medical_Workbench.md)). Medical crafting increases
[Field Medic](Field_Medic.md "wikilink") skill. This workbench is also used
to craft [Sleeping Bags](Sleeping_Bag.md "wikilink"), and while doing so
continues to increase the Field Medic skill.

- Please note that crafting items at a Medical Workbench will level you
  very slowly compared to just bandaging units.

## Labouring

Very straightforward. Just give them a labor job and leave them alone.
Loading a backpack up with heavy stuff and making them carry it around
in their inventory (not on their back) might be helpful to train
strength when hauling their stuff in the long run.

## Outpost Skills

These skills are almost exclusively used at a player outpost but can
still be trained at some buildings in towns. Make sure to keep a light
source near these buildings in order to avoid Working in Darkness stat
drainage which will reduce the quality of the station's output. Working
in Darkness does not have an effect on XP rates aside from slowing
production speeds.

### Cooking

The [Cooking](Cooking.md "wikilink") statistic will affect the speed of
cooking. There is no specific skill requirement for different recipes,
or increased quality of food produced.

### Farming

[Farming](Farming.md "wikilink") stat will affect the speed of farming as
well as the success chance in which characters harvest crops from farms.
The more farming skill a character has, the less likely they will fail
to harvest a crop. Having over 1.0 in yield will not result in bonus
crops.

### Science

[Science](Science.md "wikilink") statistic is a skill which will enable
characters to research [Technology](Technology.md "wikilink") faster as it
levels up. Additionally, the science skill will determine the range and
accuracy of [Prospecting](Prospecting.md "wikilink"). Working at a
[Research Bench](Research_Bench.md "wikilink") or on an [](Electrical_Workbench.md) will boost
[Science](Science.md "wikilink") experience.

## Robotics

[Robotics](Robotics_(Skill).md "wikilink") is trained when doing repairs on
a [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") or character with a [](Robot_Limbs.md). It can also be trained by crafting at a
[Robotics Bench](Robotics_Bench.md "wikilink") or [](Skeleton_Limb_Bench.md). You can train XP continuously by
having someone repeatedly craft Motor \> Press \> Skeleton Muscle \>
Robotics Component \> Skeleton Repair Kit \> Skeleton Repair Kit. Make
sure to keep a light source nearby the crafting station in order to
avoid Working in Darkness stat drainage which will reduce the quality of
the station's output. Working in darkness does not have an effect on XP
rates aside from slowing production speeds.

You can also station [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") in some place
like [Gut](Gut.md "wikilink"), [](The_Shrieking_Forest.md), [](Bonefields.md) etc... Zones where there are constant
hordes of enemies who deal cut damage. Have your
[Robotics](Robotics.md "wikilink") character nearby - on Passive if they
aren't a Skeleton, and Attacking Enemies if they are - ready to repair
the continuous stream of damage. Taking Cutting damage is the goal, as
any stun (What blunt damage does) damage will recover on its own.

## Strength

### Encumbrance

If you wish to build your [Strength](Strength.md "wikilink") up, a safe
tactic is to get a stacking [Backpack](Backpacks.md "wikilink") full of
[Raw Iron](Raw_Iron.md "wikilink") and keep the backpack in your inventory
instead of on your back. This will maintain a high encumbrance
percentage up to level 100. Please note that this method is very slow
and will take hundreds of days to reach 100 if that is your goal, and
requires you to have a town loaded in. Without a town loaded in the max
level of Strength reachable via walking is 96.65636 as a Shek. It is
however safe and able to be done with multiple characters at a time. To
achieve the full 50% XP rate, these characters need to be carrying
someone. Any items carried by the unit you are carrying do NOT add onto
your encumbrance, but carrying a unit does add 30 to your weight.

When not training or fighting, overload your characters and assign them
jobs where they'll do a lot of running. Alternatively overload them and
assign them to follow a patrol or some other traveling character around.
Make sure to assign "follow" as a job to prevent your characters from
stopping once they get interrupted somehow. A carried (not worn)
backpack full of stacks of ore makes a great set of training weights.
Important to add that swimming while encumbered will not result on any
strength XP.

### Weapons

Gaining strength XP while melee fighting is based on the required
strength level of the weapon (Which is 40x the blunt damage of the
weapon, or the weapons base weight, whichever is greater). You will
receive more exp per hit for every strength level you are below the
required level to use, capping out at (110% XP) 20 levels below.

### Martial Arts

Characters can earn strength fairly quickly by overloading their
character with encumbrance, and then fighting with martial arts. The STR
XP you gain for hitting a unit is based off your encumbrance percentage.
This caps at 100%, therefore it is 10% worse than using a weapon that
you lack 20 Strength or more to use. Martial Arts also lacks far reach
with their attacks making it even slower than using a weapon to train
Strength.

## Thievery

### Stealth

The absolute fastest way to train [Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink") is by
sneaking nearby massive amounts of enemies. For a more passive approach
you can activate stealth mode on while doing other things. The stealth
ability will only improve while a char is both moving and while also in
proximity to an NPC or animal that might see them, so training stops if
'out of range' of NPCs or animals. Stealth improves whether you are
visible or not to the NPC (i.e. being 'spotted' doesn't stop stealth
training), so remaining in stealth while moving around in town is a
safe, however extremely slow training tactic. Note that athletics also
improves while running under stealth, but your character will just move
more slowly at earlier levels. Since characters can remain in stealth
mode while doing other jobs, a safe way to auto-train stealth is to give
them any job(s) that makes them move long distances while close to NPCs.
One possibility is to have them stealth and then set a job to mining a
node outside of a friendly town and then return the ore to a storage box
inside town. They will train stealth from trying to sneak past the town
NPCs. This works in locations like The Hub, since the gate guards in
other towns have a 'bag-check' dialog which can halt the character's
movement until you respond to them. Please note that this is extremely
slow experience and by sneaking near many hostiles you can level your
stealth from 1 to 90 in a few in game hours. (Minutes in real life
playing at max speed)

### Lockpicking

An effective way to train lockpicking early is by entering a cage,
lockpicking it and then re-entering the cage. The cage automatically
locks upon entering. You can repeat the process as many times as
necessary, lockpicking yourself out of the cage and then re-entering it.
Common places to find cages are inside the police stations located in
every town. Bast has many cages to break out of as well. Successfully
picking a lock grants 5x the experience that failing does. The
difficulty of the lock does not change the experience gained.

### Thieving

You only gain XP in [Thievery](Thievery.md "wikilink") when stealing from a
container or unit when there is a chance of failing. If the chance of
stealing is 98% or higher, no XP will be gained. When no one is inside
of the building you are stealing from the chances of being caught are
reduced, even more if the doors are closed. An effective method to
quickly level up ones thieving skill is to find an enemy that is downed
but playing dead with their leg health below their KO point. Commonly,
they will notice if you try to steal their items, but do not get up,
which allows for fast experience gain. You can repeatedly put the same
item in and out of their inventory while paused to manually train as
long as your patience holds out. If they get up to initiate combat with
the thief, that is okay too since they are already injured and therefore
can be easily defeated again.

Stealing items that aren't in containers will give very small amounts of
XP but without any risk of being caught as long as you aren't seen. Pick
up a bunch of items off of shelves while sneaking and repeatedly drop
them and pick them up again at night, or behind an object that blocks
line of sight.

One of the fastest ways to train thievery is in the Northern cannibal
territory as they do not activate the 20 second time check that normally
occurs when you are caught. This means that you can steal from the same
chest during pause over and over just by putting the stolen items back
in the chest and stealing them once more. Works great with stackable
items.

### Assassination

In early stages, [Assassination](Assassination.md "wikilink") can be
trained by making use of an [](Assassination_Dummy.md), built by the player or used in
[Thieves Guild](Thieves_Guild.md "wikilink") watchtowers. Once some levels
are acquired, the player will have to try to assassinate other
characters for experience gain. Safe, but perhaps a less effective
method is by knocking out prisoners, which are held in cages.

An opportunistic way to skill up is by waiting until two groups fight
each other. Eventually an opponent with damaged legs will attempt to
flee by crawling away. Enter stealth mode and attempt a KO. A failure is
preferred as it gives 3x the XP and can be repeated until a KO succeeds.
Carry the now unconscious opponent away from any guards. As long as
their legs remain injured, they will only be able to crawl away when
they wake up. Repeat. You can keep earning xp this way until loading a
save which can break the cycle as they forget they should flee.
Otherwise, it can continue until they die of preventable hunger or
bloodloss.

It is relatively safe to attempt to assassinate [](Fog_Heavy.md) while they are trying to eat their
victims. After a failed attempt, they will ignore you and go right back
to what they were doing. Furthermore, it has been noted that the
[Wandering Assassins](Wandering_Assassin.md "wikilink") do not respond to
assassination attempts. However, this does reduce your relationship with
the [Shinobi Thieves](Shinobi_Thieves.md "wikilink").

In slave start you can repeatedly try to knock out fellow slaves who are
placed on prisoner poles at night. This method will rapidly increase
your skill but requires constant attention and clicking. However, this
method is completely safe and can be also useful for improving the
stealth skill.

## Toughness

Get beat up. Every received point of damage can get characters the same
amount of XP, but the best way to gain is by standing up instead of
playing dead. The best enemies for training
[Toughness](Toughness.md "wikilink") against are enemies which will not
capture, enslave or eat unconscious characters. A recommended enemy is
Starving Bandits in Skinners roam.

Cannibalistic [Hostile Factions](Hostile_Factions.md "wikilink") can also
help players increase their toughness. While a prisoner in a
[Cannibals](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink") camp or a [](Fog_Deathyard.md), the location's residents will
start eating their prey. This can easily lead to lost limbs. Players can
create situations like this except without danger by building a [](Peeler_Machine.md) into their outpost.

Contrary to what the game suggests, wearing high quality [](Heavy_Armour.md) actually helps you increase your
Toughness faster. This is because Heavy Armour reduces damages, meaning
characters can take more hits before passing out instead of falling
instantly because the enemy made a lucky shot. Characters which have
been knocked out should wake up faster when wearing Heavy Armour because
the hit which knocked them out is more likely to do less cut damage,
meaning that the character shouldn't be damaged as far below their
knockout point. Waking up from a knockout in the middle of a battle
gives characters a chance for "Playing Dead," which can be stopped for a
huge XP boost.

[Category:Guides](Category:Guides "wikilink")

Tech defines the level of development (the highest level of [](Research_Bench.md) you can build). New levels allow the
player to build new structures and research further. Characters with
higher [Science](Science.md "wikilink") [skill](Skills.md "wikilink") will
research new tech faster. **Technology** falls into 8 different
categories, with 6 different levels, the higher level permits more
advanced technology in their respective category. Some tech can only be
learned from [Blueprints](Blueprints.md "wikilink"). For a complete
overview and a technology tree [go here](Tech_tree.md "wikilink"). For a

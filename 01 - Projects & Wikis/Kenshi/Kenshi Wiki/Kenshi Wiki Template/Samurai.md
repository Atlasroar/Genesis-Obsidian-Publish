## Interactions

Patrols of Samurai have a chance of talking to the player, where they
will remark on the player being short on bodyguards. They will then
offer to escort the player, and if accepted will bodyguard the player
for 2 hours.

Patrols of Samurai may talk to the player while they are starving. If
they have the Honorable [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink") they will
take pity on the character by giving them 1 [Bread](Bread.md "wikilink"), 1
[Meatwrap](Meatwrap.md "wikilink"), and 1
[Greenfruit](Greenfruit.md "wikilink"). They may also instead attempt to
arrest the player unless manages to bribe them with 2000 cats. Once
convinced, they may offer the player a piece of
[Bread](Bread.md "wikilink") to last them until the nearest town.

This page is a guide to Kenshi's world [Factions](Factions.md "wikilink").
If you don't want to be attacked everywhere you go, you gotta make some
allies -- or, at least, not attack everyone. Note that [](Hostile_Factions.md), and some relations-improving
techniques, such as turning in bounties, will not work on them. Most
cities and towns are run by more civilized factions, and the player's
faction relations will determine whether they are allowed to enter and
trade in that city, or whether they will be attacked on-sight by the
powerful [Samurai Gate Guards](Samurai_Gate_Guard.md "wikilink"). The
following information should help you survive these more civilized
groups as you move through the [](World_of_Kenshi.md).

At -30 Relations, factions become hostile towards the player. At +50
Relations, factions become allied to the player.

## Important Characters

### Faction Pacifiers

[Pacifiers](Pacifiers.md "wikilink") are people found in the various bars
of the world that you can pay a large amount of cats to in exchange for
fixing negative faction relations.

### Diplomatic Status

People with diplomatic status are not actual diplomats. They are
characters that are important to their faction. Should they be attacked
the player will incur the full wrath of their faction.

## Harming Relations

Player can ruin relations with various factions in a number of ways. One
way is to imprison characters of a said faction by putting them in a
[Prisoner Cage](Prisoner_Cage.md "wikilink") or a [](Peeler_Machine.md). Upon first dialogue with an
imprisoned character the relations will drop by 1.

## Improving Relations

Most factions have ways to improve relations through dialogue options.
One of the ways to improve relations with big factions like the Holy
Nation, the Shek Kingdom or the United Cities is to hand over bounties
at respective police stations.

Relations can also be improved when the player bandages/repairs hurt
characters of a faction. The amount of gained relations depend on
importance of character to their faction. For example: healing a leader
of a faction can bring relations with that faction to from -100 to 5 in
seconds. You do NOT need to be seen healing the character to improve
your relations with the faction.

### After Harming Relations

As long as the player hasn't angered the faction by killing or
imprisoning a faction leader or allying with a faction the pacifier
faction doesn't accept, [Pacifiers](Pacifiers.md "wikilink") should be open
to accepting money in exchange for improved relations. Where pacifiers
can be found, and these conditions are listed in the
[Pacifiers](Pacifiers.md "wikilink") page.

The pacifier increases relations the minimum amount for each range. A
player with -90 relations with the Traders Guild would need to pay
100,000 Cats and then pay another 15,000 Cats in order to be at 0
relations. Pacifiers become "done for the day" after changing a player's
relations and the player has to wait 2 hours before the pacifier will
talk to them about relations again.

### Becoming Allies

![](Antislaversally.jpg "Antislaversally.jpg") A lot of factions will
let you ally with them, which may affect your relations with other
factions.

## Ruining Factions

Players can attempt to destroy factions which they don't like by taking
out their leaders. Killing or imprisoning faction leaders creates new
[World States](World_States.md "wikilink") which often result in [](Town_Overrides.md). Overwritten towns are entirely
new locations and any [](Player-Owned_Buildings_in_Town.md) are completely
forgotten by the game.

Often, after killing faction leaders, the Homeless Spawns of that
faction decrease in quantity. Sometimes, other factions become
strengthened due to the power vacuum which the leader's death has
caused. This results in "invasion" Homeless Spawns in zones which this
secondary faction did not originally have claim to. This phenomena is
most noticeable after players have killed the [](Western_Hive.md)'s Queen and the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md) begins to invade most of the world.

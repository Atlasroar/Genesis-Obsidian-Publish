**Cultural Groupings And Evolution** Series is a pair of
[book](Lore_Books.md "wikilink") [Items](Items.md "wikilink"). These items can
be found with the 'unique' tag at Science HQ in [](World's_End.md). However, it can also be found without the
'unique' label in [](The_Great_Library.md) in [](Black_Scratch.md).

Both book items are considered illegal by [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). If held in the player's inventory
during a bag search at a Holy Nation town, that character will receive
a [Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") for holding illegal goods and subsequently
attacked and/or arrested.

The first book was written by [Idad](Idad.md "wikilink") and the second
book was written by the current leader of
the [Machinists](Machinists.md "wikilink"), [Finch](Finch.md "wikilink").

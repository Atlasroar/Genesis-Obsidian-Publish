![](Sake-Distill.jpg "Sake-Distill.jpg") A **Sake Still** creates
[Sake](Sake.md "wikilink") from [Riceweed](Riceweed.md "wikilink"). It can be
constructed after researching [](Sake_Distillation_(Tech).md) and requires a worker
to operate.

Processing [Riceweed](Riceweed.md "wikilink") into [Sake](Sake.md "wikilink")
trains a party member's [Cooking](Cooking.md "wikilink") stat, and as such
brewing time is affected by the Cooking multiplier.

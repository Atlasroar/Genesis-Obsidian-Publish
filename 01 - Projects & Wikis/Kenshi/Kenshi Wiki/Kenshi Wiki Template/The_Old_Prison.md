**The Old Prison** is the base of [](The_Gorrillo_Bandits.md). It is located in the
Southeastern corner of the [Bonefields](Bonefields.md "wikilink"), almost
directly South of [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink"). Inside you will find the
leader of the faction, [Gorrillo](Gorrillo.md "wikilink"), and his [](Gorillo_Bandit.md).

The Old Prison complex consists of the main tower resembling an [](Ancient_Tech_Lab.md), fairly sophisticated walls and a
destroyed [Watchtower](Watchtower.md "wikilink"), suggesting several prior
uses before becoming a home of the bulky brawlers.

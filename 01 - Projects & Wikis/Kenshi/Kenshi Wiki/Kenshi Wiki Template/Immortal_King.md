**The Immortal King** is a character that does not exist in the game,
but can be found in the [](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md).

He does have unique dialogue lines which all lead to fighting. Each of
his stats is equal to 1 like a new player character. Not very much is
known about him. The developers just scrapped him from the game or made
him "cut content". His name might suggest that further development of
the concept of this character lead to the introduction of
[Cat-Lon](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink") in the final release of the game.

**Holy Nation Assault (Major)**, simply referred to as 'Holy Nation
Assault' in-game, is an [event](Events.md "wikilink") that can occur if the
player has defeated the [Holy Assault](Holy_Assault.md "wikilink"), [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Minor).md), or
**Holy Nation Assault (Major)** events. It is closely related to, but
not to be confused with, two other events of the same name, [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Minor).md), and [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Inquisitor).md).

The event cannot trigger if the [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md), [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md), and [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) are all killed or captured.

If the requirements above are met, [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) will send an assault to the player's
outpost in 100-250 hours if it was triggered off of a [](Holy_Assault.md) event, 72-110 hours if it was trigger
off of a [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Minor).md) event, or 72-200 hours
if it was triggered off of a **Holy Nation Assault (Major)** event. The
assault will consist of 10-12 [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), 1-2 [](High_Paladin.md), and 4-9 [](Holy_Servant.md) being led by an
[Inquisitor](Inquisitor.md "wikilink").

After arriving at the outpost, the War Leader will order his men to
attack the outpost and the player characters inside it. If the raid is
victorious, they will occupy the player's base, patrolling around it,
using the furniture, freeing captives, and imprisoning your characters.
If the raid is defeated, there is a 30% chance to trigger another **Holy
Nation Assault (Major)** event in 72-200 hours, and a 20% or 40% chance
(If [High Inquisitor Valtena](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md "wikilink") has
been killed or captured it will be 40%, if not then it will be 20%) to
trigger a [](Holy_Nation_Assault_(Inquisitor).md) event in
72-200 hours.

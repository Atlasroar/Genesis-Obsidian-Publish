The **Falling Sun**, like the other [](Heavy_Weapons_(Class).md), has an extremely high damage
potential, sometimes doing enough damage to outright kill an opponent in
one hit. The Falling Sun is the lightest of the Heavy Weapons. As it has
a lower blunt damage amount, it requires less strength to be able to use
it effectively. An experienced user is someone to be feared.

The damage boost against Gorillos applies to only standard
[Gorillo](Gorillo.md "wikilink") and the [](Great_White_Gorillo.md), not [](Black_Gorillo.md) or the [](King_Gorillo.md) (nor the character
[Gorrillo](Gorrillo.md "wikilink") and his [](The_Gorrillo_Bandits.md) for that matter).

The Falling Sun stands out among heavy weapons for its greater cutting
damage compared to its blunt damage, making a Rusted Junk quality one a
somewhat viable [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink") training weapon.

This weapon has inventory dimensions of **2x10**, meaning it can only be
used as a primary weapon. Like other heavy weapons, this item will not
fit into standard inventories. It must either be equipped or carried
inside a backpack.

High-quality versions of this weapon are commonly found in the
[Scraphouse](Scraphouse.md "wikilink"). Low to Medium quality versions of
this weapon are sometimes found in [Shek](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink"),
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink"), [Flotsam](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink"), and
[Tech Hunter](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink") weapon shops.
[Cross](Cross.md "wikilink")-manufactured Falling Sun is found on one
[ancient leader](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink"). A Rusted Junk quality version
may be found extremely rarely in bars in [The Hub](The_Hub.md "wikilink")
or [Mourn](Mourn.md "wikilink"), in shops in the Shek Kingdom, or crafted.

The [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink")-version of this weapon can be found on
[Mad Cat-Lon](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink"), the leader of the [](Second_Empire_Exile.md).

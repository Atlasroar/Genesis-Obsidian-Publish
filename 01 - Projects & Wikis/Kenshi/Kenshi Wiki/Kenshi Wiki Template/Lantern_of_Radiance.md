The **Lantern of Radiance** is a [lantern](Lanterns.md "wikilink") that
produces a small radius of light around the character when worn in the
belt slot. The lantern can be purchased from
[hivers](Western_Hive.md "wikilink") who will claim it protects you from
the creatures of the [Fog Islands](Fog_Islands.md "wikilink"). However, the
lantern has no anomalous effects. Ironically if sneaking through the Fog
Islands it could cause you to be discovered, leading to combat and maybe
death if unprepared.

The lanterns have both charges and quality, but the charges never
decrease, and the quality will always stay at 20.

[Western Hive Caravan Traders](Hive_Trader_Caravan.md "wikilink") will
pester players into purchasing a Lantern of Radiance for c.2,500 while
its retail price is c.90. It's likely because of this that there are
some dialogues in game complaining about being scammed from Hivers.

## Tips

- Wearing the Lantern of Radiance will affect your
  [stats](Statistics.md "wikilink") in relation to
  [Lighting](Lighting.md "wikilink"). (Meaning that mining, crafting or
  shooting at night will give only small debuffs).
- Sneaking will be more difficult while wearing the Lantern of Radiance.
- Most other light sources (i.e. a [torch post](Torch_Post.md "wikilink"))
  are still superior to the Lantern of Radiance in terms of brightness
  as they completely negate the penalty of working in the dark.
- Lanterns can be placed onto NPCs when they are sleeping to help keep
  track of them better at night.
- If for whatever reason you wanted to have 200 charges you can sell a
  lantern to the store, close the shop, and then open it back up and
  purchase the lantern. It will have full charges.
- Attacking Hiver Caravans is a great and quick way to get tons of
  lanterns for large squads as they always spawn with one on their hip.

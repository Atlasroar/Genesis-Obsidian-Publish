**The Grid** is an area northeast of [](The_Crater.md) and southwest of [](The_Swamp.md). It contains a [](Workshop_Complex.md) with two workshops, so it's a
great place to find high grade weapons, [](Engineering_Research.md) and [](Ancient_Science_Book.md).

## Inhabitants

There are no [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") or [](Minor_Outposts.md) in The Grid. This zone does not
spawn Camps or have any Homeless Spawns.

### Ancient Locations

*These are places which do not have competent inhabitants. Ancient
Locations are usually lost outposts or ruins. Beware: sometimes these
locations contain territorial protectors such as [](Security_Spider.md).*

- [Workshop Complex](Workshop_Complex.md "wikilink") (Note, the Workshop
  Complex on the map is empty. However there is one to the west and one
  to the east of it with loot)

## Environment

### Weather

*This zone has the 'Swamp' season. Seasons may cause harmful [](Weather_Effects.md) or be purely aesthetic.*

- Swamp rain no wind

### Gallery

## Tips

- [Beak Things](Beak_Thing.md "wikilink") and [Raptors](Raptors.md "wikilink")
  can be found fighting it out closer to the Crater. This could be used
  to sneak or run around them.
- The layout of the Grid sometimes makes it difficult for the camera to
  follow player characters. Zooming in can reduce this effect.

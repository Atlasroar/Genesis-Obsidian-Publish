**Espher** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink") from the
[Southern Hive](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Southern_Hive.md "wikilink"). Espher is imprisoned within
[Tengu's Vault](Tengu's_Vault.md "wikilink") with a
[Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink") of 25,000. Espher can join the player
faction after being freed from imprisonment and safely escorted away
from the prison.

Espher is the only guaranteed [](Hive.md#Southern_Hive) recruit, although all three
Southern Hive [Races](Races.md "wikilink")
([Prince](Southern_Hive_Prince.md "wikilink"), [](Southern_Hive_Soldier_Drone.md), [](Southern_Hive_Worker_Drone.md)) can potentially be found
as slaves in the [United Cities](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"). As a
Southern Hive Worker Drone, they are slightly more vulnerable to
bleeding than their Western Hive counterparts.

Espher has many lines of dialogue for escaping the Vault, but does not
have any other exclusive dialogue lines. Espher shares a single unique
dialogue line with many other named recruits.

**Crab Helmet** is a Heavy Armour that is equipped in the Headgear slot.
It is the headgear with the highest blunt resistance. Aside from the
races that cannot wear helmets, it additionally cannot be worn by [](Hive_Worker_Drone.md) and their
[southern](Southern_Hive_Worker_Drone.md "wikilink") and
[deadhive](Deadhive_Worker.md "wikilink") cousins. It can be crafted once a
blueprint is purchased from the [Crab Raiders](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md "wikilink")
and is part of a Crab Armour "set", together with [](Crab_Armour.md) (body), [](Crab_Trousers.md) and [](Crab_Shoes.md).

This armour has inventory dimensions of **3x3**.

## Appearance

The **Crab Helmet**appears to be a thick, metal Jingasa attached to a
metal cylinder with a long, wide slit for the the wearer to see through.

## Triva/Notes

- Crab Helmet has the highest blunt and cut damage mitigation of the
  helmets.
- With the only stat reduction being Perception, the Crab Helmet is the
  best in slot headwear in any scenario except for in Duststorms for
  melee fighters. Unlike the other armour pieces in the set which have
  massive penalties.
- If you do not wish to craft one you can attack Crab Raiders to obtain
  a high quality version. Crab raiders have a 50% chance of having
  standard quality armour with the other 50% chance for high quality.

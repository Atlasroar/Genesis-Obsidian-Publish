The **Armour King** is a [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink") merchant who
sellsÂ [Armour](Armour.md "wikilink") gear in [](Armour_King's_Shop.md). He is a masterful armoursmith who
produces high-end armor to give travelers superior protection.

Worth noting, he is extremely skilled in combat and is also protected by
his [Security Spider II](Security_Spider_II.md "wikilink") sentries, and
his personal [thralls](Armour_King's_Thrall.md "wikilink"), who are also
extremely skilled. He is one of a few traders who actively follows
player's character around the shop and some way outside it as well.

He can be found at the [Drowned Ruins](Drowned_Ruins.md "wikilink") in the
northwest of the map, in the river next to the [](Arm_of_Okran.md). The only way to reach him is by
swimming along the river, entering either from the south side near
[Blister Hill](Blister_Hill.md "wikilink") or the west side near
[Floodlands](Floodlands.md "wikilink").

He belongs to the [Skeletons](Skeletons.md "wikilink") faction.

## Lore

**<u>(SPOILERS AHEAD)</u>**

**<u>(HUGE SPOILERS)</u>**

We know far more about Armour King's shop then we do know about Armour
King himself. According to Armour King, he started his shop in a
thriving Second Empire town called Catch nine-hundred thirty seven years
ago. This coincides very nearly with the [](History_of_Kenshi.md), yet Catch (a Second Empire town)
was still thriving, meaning that the fall of the Second Empire likely
didn't occur at a set date; it probably occurred over a very long period
of time, with select towns falling into rebellion or disrepair, until
eventually all that was left of the Second Empire was [](Cat-Lon's_Exile.md). This is further supported by what
Armour King says about the collapse of the Second Empire.

We do know that Armour King has travelled around the world (he uses it
in his sales pitch) and that he took Thralls from the Ashlands and
modified them to work in his shop. Whether he took already broken
skeletons or did [](Skeleton_No-Head_MkII.md) is not elaborated
on.![](Armour_King.png "Armour_King.png")

## Trivia

- The Armour King was introduced in beta *v0.93.0* northwest area
  update.
- The Armour King will often make frequent sales pitches as your
  characters remain in the Armor King's shop.
- The [Thralls](Armour_King's_Thrall.md "wikilink") in the Armour King's
  were taken from the [Ashlands](Ashlands.md "wikilink") and modified by
  Armour King himself to be extremely dangerous as well as perceptive in
  order to catch thieves, even with no heads. Armour King claims this is
  because of their upgraded armour and special audio sensors in their
  hands.
- Strangely Armour King only has level 1 Armoursmithing.
- If caught lockpicking/stealing by the Armour King you will be attacked
  by the Thralls. However if the Thralls see you lockpicking and not the
  Armour King they will just watch.
- The Armour Kings shop is the only place to find Masterwork Hive Shirt
  Armour.

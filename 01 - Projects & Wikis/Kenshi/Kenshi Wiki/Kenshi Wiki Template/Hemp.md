**Hemp** is a raw material harvested from [](Hemp_Farm.md) or [](Hydroponic_Hemp.md) stations and processed at a Fabric
Loom (Hemp) to create [Fabrics](Fabrics.md "wikilink"). It can be stored in
the [Storage: Hemp](Storage:_Hemp "wikilink") container. It can be also
processed into [Fuel](Fuel.md "wikilink") at a [](Biofuel_Distillery_(Hemp).md) or into a number of
Medical Items.

It is considered illegal by the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) due to its potential of being turned
into [Hashish](Hashish.md "wikilink") at a [](Hemp_Processor.md). It should not be assumed that
it's the same with [The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") or
[Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink"), as neither of them outlaw Hemp
despite banning Hashish.

### Used in

### Locations

Can be bought from relevant [Traders](Traders.md "wikilink") in non-[](Holy_Nation.md) settlements.

### History

Hemp and [Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink") both initially had icons
which simply looked like bundles. Wheatstraw was a yellow version
whereas Hemp was this green one.

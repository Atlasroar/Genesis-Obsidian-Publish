**Fuel** is essential to keep generators running in areas where [](Power.md) is not reliable.

To acquire fuel, a player can buy it from construction traders or steal
it from various places, additionally it can sometimes be found in ruined
buildings.

The above means of acquiring fuel can be substituted by researching
[Biofuel](Biofuel_(Tech).md "wikilink"), and building [](Biofuel_Distillery.md), which can convert
[Greenfruit](Greenfruit.md "wikilink"),
[Wheatstraw](Wheatstraw.md "wikilink"), and [Hemp](Hemp.md "wikilink") into
Fuel, providing a free and reliable source, though somewhat more labor
intensive and time consuming.

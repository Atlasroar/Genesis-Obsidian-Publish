![](Dead_fogmen.png "Dead_fogmen.png") The **Fogmen**(also known as the
**Deadhive**) are a savage group of [Hivers](Hive.md "wikilink") lurking
within the [Fog Islands](Fog_Islands.md "wikilink"). Anyone who enters the
Fog Islands are doomed to be attacked by the Fogmen, who are a constant
threat to the people in the nearby town of
[Mongrel](Mongrel.md "wikilink").

## Overview

Upon attacking and incapacitating any non-skeleton characters, nearby
Fogmen will attempt to carry the injured person(s) back to their camps,
where they will be tied to a pole and eaten alive by [](Fog_Prince.md) in a ritualistic feast. It should be
noted that even if all nearby Fogmen are killed, the injured person is
still in immense danger as Fogmen will continue coming for them. They
will often not attempt to fight after kidnapping their victim, merely
running in to get the body and retreating back to camp. While it is
possible to rescue captives, as their limbs will be eaten first, heavy
caution is advised.

Their main weakness is that Fogmen are only barely able warriors, and
are individually very fragile. To make up for this weakness, they roam
in large groups of [Fogmen](Fogman.md "wikilink") and [](Fog_Heavy.md). Any time a group of Fogmen are attacked,
there is a chance that more Fogmen will appear to swarm their
adversaries. With their vast manpower, they can even take down a group
of skilled warriors.

They are known to supposedly be controlled by a neurological parasite,
but the details are unknown, and the reliability of these rumors are
questionable. It appears that it is impossible for them to regain
control of themselves by any means. Whatever causes their behavior, they
are completely feral beyond their ritual cannibalization of humanoids.
They have no voice lines beyond incoherent screaming.

If both of Hiver [queens](Hive_Queen.md "wikilink") are dead, Fogmen will
spread to all of the former Hiver locations, supporting a theory that
Hivers cannot function without pheromones of their queens, even if
separated from them.

### Deathyards

The Fog Islands are littered with so-called Deathyards, which are large
nest of Fogmen that constantly spawn fogmen at an alarming rate. Within
the center of these fogmen nest are prison pole from which people
captured by the fogmen are eaten alive. Typically, deathyards are
spawned within one of the many large craters of the fog islands. Fogmen
regularly patrol the roads which criss-cross the Fog Islands, and it is
possible to be easily be overwhelmed by a horde of Fogmen due to the
presence of several Deathyards located next to each other.

Deathyards, like animal nest and bandit camps, can be destroyed. It
would require killing most of the Fogmen which were spawned by that
Deathyard, as well as specifically killing the Fogmen Princes. However,
also like animal nests, they are not permanently destroyed and will
respawn after some time. This can be notoriously difficult if multiple
deathyards are close to one another, as you would have to also deal with
the patrols of the nearby Deathyards before you can kill your current
target.

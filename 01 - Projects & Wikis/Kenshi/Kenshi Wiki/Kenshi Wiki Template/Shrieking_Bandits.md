**Shrieking Bandits** are a hostile faction found in [](The_Shrieking_Forest.md), [](Purple_Sands.md) and in the NW region of [](The_Cannibal_Plains.md). As their name implies, they are
unintelligible, possibly due to chronic malnutrition and reduced mental
capacity. However, the player can vocalize with some leaders in a series
of grunts and gestures, possibly avoiding conflict (or instigating one
if choosing the wrong one).

**Esata the Stone Golem** is the leader of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) and has [](Diplomatic_Status.md).

She can be found in the Faction HQ in [Admag](Admag.md "wikilink") along
with her daughter [Seto](Seto.md "wikilink"), [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink"),
and 4 other of [The Five Invincibles](The_Five_Invincibles.md "wikilink"),
unless World States have moved the Shek HQ.

Esata wields a legendary [Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") [](Fragment_Axe.md), but is too weak to wield it and thus,
quite straightforward to defeat by a skilled
[crossbowman](Crossbows.md "wikilink"). Otherwise — in melee combat — she
is a force to be reckoned with. She has a [Bounty](Bounty.md "wikilink")
from [The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") and [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md).

Players can join the [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") by gaining
75 reputation points with it, which can be achieved by returning in
diverse bounties or instantly by capturing the
[Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink") or any of the Holy Nation's leaders (
[Holy Lord Phoenix](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md "wikilink"), [](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md) or [](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md) ) and bringing them to Esata. If
players manage to kill or kidnap Esata, the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md) leader will become [](Mukai_the_Mountain.md).

## History

Esata is the first of the Shek leaders to want to address their
kingdom’s problem of a declining population, however this new strategic
rationality has caused a divide in it’s battle hungry citizens. Fiery
and fueled by her anger for her enemies, Esata is a little less
conventional than other past leaders in that she places bigger victory
on long-term crushing of enemies. She tries to balance prosperity with
glory, while keeping the religious and warmongering aspirations of her
people happy.

The [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") puts little importance on
academic education, meaning that most Shek can’t read – Esata is no
exception to this and is not particularly intelligent. She does,
however, have formidable battle skills and an open mind to rational
thought. Her aide on the other hand, [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink"), is an
impressive intellect. Although the talent of intellects is normally
wasted in the traditional Shek Kingdom, Esata relies on Bayan for his
advice, for the good of the nation.

Only the best of the Shek warrior can earn battle names, and Esata
earned hers ‘the Stone Golem’ when she joined [](The_Five_Invincibles.md), the Kingdom’s highest
ranking fighters. It was during this time that Esata served under the
previous emperor, [Shager](Shager's_Overthrow.md "wikilink"), whom she
challenged on his plans for a potential suicide mission against [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md). After a hard-hitting battle
one day, [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink") protested against Shager’s plans for
a suicide attack against The Holy Nation to regain their honor. In
response to Shager’s angry threats against his ‘cowardice’, Esata
stepped in and boomed, ‘the man speaks the truth. You want Bayan
silenced, you’ll have to cut me down first”. She fought and defeated
Shager, becoming the new leader in his place.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

If Esata the Stone Golem is killed/imprisoned there are several world
states that would trigger.

[Admag](Admag.md "wikilink") would fall under
[Berserkers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink") rule. (It will spawn
[Ghost](Ghost.md "wikilink") in Admag if he hasn't been killed/imprisoned)

[Squin](Squin.md "wikilink") will have a town override which would include
[Mukai](Mukai_the_Mountain.md "wikilink") and still being under SK rule. Or
handed over to [Kral's Chosen](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md "wikilink") if [](Mukai_the_Mountain.md) is killed/imprisoned while
[Flying Bull](Flying_Bull.md "wikilink") is alive and free. If Flying Bull
is killed/imprisoned as well with Mukai, Squin will fall under the
control of [Berserkers](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink").

If [Stack](Stack.md "wikilink") and [Bad Teeth](Bad_Teeth.md "wikilink") is
under Shek Kingdom rule, it would fall to [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Kral's_Chosen.md) rule if [](Flying_Bull.md) is alive and free. If Flying Bull is
killed/imprisoned as well, both towns will fall to ruins under [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md) rule.

[Hundred Guardian](Hundred_Guardian.md "wikilink") and [](Shek_Warrior.md) patrols will cease to spawn in [](Border_Zone.md), [Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink")
and [Okran's Pride](Okran's_Pride.md "wikilink") regions if the World State
for them to spawn there is achieved before hand.

[Kamikaze](Kamikaze.md "wikilink") patrols will start invading [](Border_Zone.md), [Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink"),
[Okran's Pride](Okran's_Pride.md "wikilink") and [](Skinner's_Roam.md) regions. If [](Mukai_the_Mountain.md) is alive and free they can be
found patrolling [Stenn Desert](Stenn_Desert.md "wikilink") region.

[The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") will start spawning 2
types of counter-attack patrols consisting of 3-5
[Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink"), 6-8 [](Holy_Sentinel.md) and 30-45 [](Holy_Chosen.md) and another patrol consisting of 1 [](High_Paladin.md), 4-6 [Paladins](Paladin.md "wikilink")
and 6-10 [Holy Servants](Holy_Servant.md "wikilink") if [](Holy_Lord_Phoenix.md) is alive and free. The latter
patrol can spawn with twice more frequency if [Seto](Seto.md "wikilink") is
killed/imprisoned as well.

The death/capturement of Esata the Stone Golem will also prompt a
dialogue from a Paladin with the following words:

"Bless you, holy {Player Name}, how you managed to take down the Golem
I'll never know.. Soon we will be purging the last of her beasts...
Before the barbarians reach to our gates for blood like the psychopaths
they are."

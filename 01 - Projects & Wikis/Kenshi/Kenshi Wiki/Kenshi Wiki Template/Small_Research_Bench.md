The Small Research Bench is the starting point for those wanting to
access new types of technologies and buildings. While quickly replaced,
it is necessary to advance your factions technology level (e.g. [](Tech_Level_(Tech).md)) which will unlock other better
[Research Benches](Research_Bench.md "wikilink"). Researching from multiple
benches is possible and gives diminishing returns on the speed of
research with every new bench used in the process.

*Note: The Small Research Bench cannot be upgraded into [](Research_Bench.md).*

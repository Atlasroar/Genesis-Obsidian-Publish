The **Flotsam Ninjas** are a [Faction](Factions.md "wikilink") mostly made
up of women who escaped the oppression of [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md), though they do have some former
slaves from [Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") in their ranks as well. They
have taken refuge in [](Flotsam_Village.md) under [Moll's](Moll.md "wikilink")
protection. Here they will for the first time be able to wield a sword,
learn to read, and freely express their opinions. Many Flotsam Ninjas
still worship [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink"). However, they follow a
different version of the religion, with sexist aspects excluded.

They live in a hidden village near the [](Cannibal_Plains.md), as the painted tribes provide a
good deterrent from their oppressors.

If the player comes across their territory, they will start
interrogating the player about their reasons for being there. Women and
non-humans can usually get through fairly easily, while male humans will
have to go through a bit of extra trouble.

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

- [The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") (-100)

### Player Relations

*The reasons for this faction to have a non-zero relation towards you.*

- Agreeing with Moll when she mentions cannibals being good target
  practice will result in +1 Relations.
- The Player has an option when talking to [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") to
  either side with the Flotsam Ninjas or the Holy Nation. Choosing one
  will negatively affect your relations with the other. (+/-75)
- If the player turns in Moll to earn her 50,000 c. bounty, their
  relations with the Flotsam Ninjas will be severely damaged.

**Drifters**are randomly-named members of several factions. Depending on
their squad they can be part of the: [Drifters](Drifters.md "wikilink"),
[Tech Hunters](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Tech_Hunters.md "wikilink"),
[Mongrel](Mongrel_(Faction).md "wikilink"), [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md), [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md), and
[Vagrants](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Vagrants.md "wikilink"). They can be found squatting in many
towns as well as patrolling some zones. Their race is randomly
determined by their faction.

Drifters that are members of the Tech Hunters can be recruited as
bodyguards and outpost guards for the same rate as members of the
[Mercenary Guild](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Mercenary_Guild.md "wikilink").

They have a 4% chance of having a bounty ranging from 1 to 4000 Cats.

Drifter characters have a chance of triggering recruitment dialogue if
they are healed by the player. They have a random
[Personality](Personality.md "wikilink") but are more likely to be
recruited if Honorable. After being recruited, they will have the
"Player TOUGH Merc" dialogue package.

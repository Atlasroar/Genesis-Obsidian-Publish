**Pack Bulls** are [animals](Fauna.md "wikilink") which can be found
following [Trade Caravans](Trade_Caravan "wikilink") in Kenshi. There
are other types of Bulls, such as [](Domesticated_Bull.md) which can be purchased by the
player and [Wild Bulls](Wild_Bull.md "wikilink") which can be found in
roaming groups.

Wild Bulls are, on average, slightly stronger in combat than the other
types of bulls by having a few extra combat skill levels. Pack Bulls
spawn with a [Bull Backpack](Bull_Backpack.md "wikilink").

Pack Bulls are allowed to keep their horns unlike the Domesticated
Bulls, which give them a massive damage advantage in combat compared to
their hornless comrades. This may mean that they are selected for their
role as pack animals from a very young age.

## Damage Calculations

These values are for when striking a target with 0% damage resistance.
Animals can have one of three qualities for their "weapon". (Moving
their position in a squad, saving and then reloading can change to
another quality of the weapon) The 23 in the cut calculation is from the
minimum cut damage (13) combined with 10 piercing damage which Pack
Bulls have.

**<u>Variant 1</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.8774025 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0039) + Strength (0.0117)

**<u>Variant 2</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.89232 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0052) + Strength (0.0156)

**<u>Variant 3</u>**

**Cut =** 23 + 0.9072375 (Martial Arts + Dex)

**Blunt =** Martial Arts (0.0065) + Strength (0.0195)

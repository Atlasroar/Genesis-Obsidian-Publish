**Version 0.20** is the first recorded update to Kenshi, being the first
fully official Alpha release. The content of the game at the time can be
deduced from the first announcement, which took place 3 days prior to
the update.

It is also the only version showing revision numbers as
***Major*.*Minor* a*Revision**'' (e.g.***0*.*20*a*7**'').

## Announcement - 28 Oct 2011

The game is all packaged up and ready to go now. I have a couple of
testers finding last minute bugs for me, and the game is now playable,
if a little empty. Remember though, its not even close to representing
the final game, I’m barely getting started.  The final map will be
bigger and full of stuff and there will be all sorts of things to
do. For now though, more detailed information is here

- There wont be much to do at first, except wander from town to town
  getting in fights and looting.
- The medical system is incomplete, and for now healing will be
  simplified
- AI will also be very limited compared to the final version.
- The terrain will be bare and empty of features and graphical effects,
  wind, shadows etc
- There’s not much in the way of variety, all characters will pretty
  much look the same.  Not much in the way of clothing or hair, and
  currently no females.
- The world map is smaller and emptier than it will be.
- Performance will likely increase at a later date
- The pathfinding is buggy
- There is no day/night cycle, water, weather, or wildlife
- There is no sound
- There is no blood
- There’s only a couple of basic factions.

The game will be up for sale from the main website here, as well as on
desura. In the free demo version you won’t be able to raise your skills
above level 20, and you can’t recruit any more characters to your team.

## 0.20 release

Here is the alpha release, as promised. Some testers have reported
crashes that I haven’t managed to fix in time, but for the majority of
systems it runs crash-free. It has a built-in auto updater too, so
crashes and bugs will soon fix themselves as if by magic.

The purchase link is going to be delayed a little, because I left it so
last minute Desura are taking their time to approve it, and I’m
honour-bound (and possibly law-bound) to synchronise the release time
with them.  So for now you can play the demo, and hopefully within the
next 24 hours you will be able to purchase it and unlock the demo to
full-version.

## 0.20 a6

- fixed a random crash
- demo mode now allows you to recruit one extra character
- pressing the BLOCKS button toggles defensive combat mode. The
  character will not make attacks, but will have a +20 bonus to his
  melee defense.
- fixed a bug that messed up someones savegame, it loads fine now
- my cough is getting better
- modders, you can toggle the level editor with shift + F12, but you
  will have trouble figuring it out. Hint: you set a buildings faction
  and division by selecting it and then choosing from the menus down the
  left.

#### NEAR FUTURE

- I need to fix some bugs in the construction set
- I will probably find more crashes to fix.
- focusing on stability and major bugs
- my cough will go away

## 0.20 a7

- Fixed one little bug that was causing all the random crashes
- Fixed bug when importing squad made backpacks break
- Something else I forgot

#### FUTURE

- Will sort out the construction set next

## 0.20 a8

- That same random crash bug persists. I hunted down the queen bug, and
  gave her a taste of my mighty beard. Try this update, and see if it
  has fixed the crashes

## 0.20 a9

- Updated the construction set to 0.4. It now tracks which properties
  you have edited, and only those will override the original data. You
  can also now delete associated items.
- fixed lots of little things
- my cough got better

#### NOTE

- the bug where your squad temporarily disappears if you move too fast
  across the map has not been entirely fixed, but you can now at least
  control your squad during this time and stop them running off to the
  ends of the map. If your squad vanishes, take it out of fast-forward
  mode and wait for the "loading" message to go away, and they will
  reappear

## 0.20 a11

#### FEATURES

- combat is now more hectic, with less idle characters, however it also
  means that fighting will be harder when outnumbered. I welcome
  feedback on this change.
- added a menu when pressing escape
- 2 main factions now at war, feel free to pick a side and join in. I
  just threw this in temporarily, until factions and alliances get more
  complicated.

#### BUG FIXES

- fixed indoor combat
- fixed loading/saving of faction relations
- fixed duplicating items
- stopped people walking through walls, and climbing up the city walls
  of Capital.
- lots of little things
- police won't attack you for using violence to help them. This may also
  stop the towns errupting into accidental civil wars.

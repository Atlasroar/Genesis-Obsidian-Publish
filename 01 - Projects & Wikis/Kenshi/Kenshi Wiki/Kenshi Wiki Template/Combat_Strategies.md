When you first begin your game, you will not have much of a chance when
going up against gangs wandering the desert. Before you engage any
opponent either with your single beginning character or with your group,
you will need to rely on other friendly groups to assist you in battle.
Use these tips and methods to your advantage and quickly advance in the
vast world of Kenshi.

## Specialized Roles

If players plan on maintaining a large group of player characters, they
should consider giving some characters a specific role during combat.

### The "Secret Medic"

Get a few men in your squad, and send them all into an impossible
battle, keeping one man back a safe distance in "Passive" mode. Once
your team gets beaten unconscious, wait for the enemy to leave, and then
move your medic in to recover your squad before they bleed to death. As
an added measure of safety, it helps to train this character in sneak
and equip them with stealth boosting gear.

### The "Tank"

To ensure that multiple hostile characters aren't attacking all player
characters, players should make one character a "Tank." This character
should be equipped with [Heavy Armour](Heavy_Armour.md "wikilink") and
should have a weapon that prioritizes [](Melee_Defense.md) over Attack. Note that, with a plus
+8 to Melee Defense, [Foreign Sabres](Foreign_Sabre.md "wikilink") are
excellent for this role. The player should switch this character into
"Taunt" mode so they can lure more units into focusing on them in
combat. This unit works well when backed by hard-hitting, highly
offensive units.

### The "Glass Cannon"

A defensive Tank is excellent for drawing attacks, but not for fighting
back; that's where your "Cannon" comes in. Their primary role is to
provide a highly aggressive, offensive force to fight alongside your
Tanks and other squaddies in melee combat. Use these units to down your
enemies swiftly, while they are otherwise engaged with your tanks. Use
these specialists to break up enemy groups into smaller units, making
them easier to take down.

These units should be equipped with either [](Light_Armour.md) or [](Medium_Armour.md) (or some combination of the two), as
well as highly offensive weapons. The ideal Cannon is equipped with
stat-boosting, high-coverage armor, as well as stat-boosted weapons;
this allows the Cannon to take full advantage of the distraction the
Tanks provide, striking the enemy hard and fast. While they do not have
to be *abysmally* armoured, keep in mind that their focus will be on
keeping the [Dexterity](Dexterity.md "wikilink") and [](Melee_Attack.md)/Melee Defense stats high. This is best
done with lighter armours, as they offer more stat boosts and fewer
penalties. With its high coverage, stat boosts, and proper protection,
the [Dustcoat](Dustcoat.md "wikilink") is a prime armour for this,
particularly when combined with [](Samurai_Clothpants.md) and [](Plated_Longboots.md). The [](Combat_Cleaver.md), with its 30% armour penetration can
be an excellent weapon for this role. However, if you have the skill,
the best weapon is arguably the [Falling Sun](Falling_Sun.md "wikilink").
It is relatively light for a [Heavy Weapon](Heavy_Weapons.md "wikilink"),
and does incredible blunt/cutting damage simultaneously, making it
effective against all types of protection.

### The "Bowman"

As anyone who's fought the [Dust Bandits](Dust_Bandit.md "wikilink") should
know, a few support units with [Crossbows](Crossbows.md "wikilink") can be
a deadly nuisance for the enemy. The "Bowman" is a support unit that can
be used to wear down the enemy at a safe distance or act as a
reinforcement as needed. This unit should be equipped with Light Armour,
Medium Armour, or some mix of the two that provides decent protection
without hindering the crossbow skill. Their weapons should consist of
both a crossbow and a sidearm of your choice; whether that sidearm is
something more offensive or defensive, is up to you. That said, it is
recommended to go with a more defensive blade (such as the
[Longsword](Longsword.md "wikilink") to account for their lighter armor and
their (likely) more significant focus on crossbows as opposed to melee
combat.

In the early stages of training, it's recommended that your Bowmen each
be given a [Tooth Pick](Tooth_Pick.md "wikilink") for squad v. squad
combat, as shots will still stagger enemies, but won't be as dangerous
for your other fighters should they accidentally shoot them. In later
stages, you may choose to equip them with more powerful bows like the
[Oldworld Bow MkII](Oldworld_Bow_MkII.md "wikilink"). Keep in mind,
however, that even with fairly high [](Precision_Shooting.md) skill, there is still some risk
that your Bowmen will shoot your other units.

A firing line of these units can significantly soften up an enemy
unit/squad, sometimes taking down opponents with a single shot. Use them
to bombard approaching enemies, and to pick off remaining enemies once
engaged.

## General Combat

### The "Retreat to Safety" Method

All [Major Towns](Major_Towns.md "wikilink") aside from [](The_Hub.md) have town guards. Town guards will defend the
town against any groups of characters from [](Hostile_Factions.md). Players should make use of this
by retreating to the nearest town every time a group begins to attack
them. Once all of the town guards are engaged with the hostile group,
players should join in the fight. Fighting alongside the town guards is
a safe way to train combat skills, primarily [](Melee_Attack.md) and
[Defense](Melee_Defense.md "wikilink"). Players with very inexperienced
characters should also employ a character as a "Secret Medic" to ensure
that if all characters are severely injured in the fight, someone is
there to heal them after the town guards have secured victory.

### The "Safety in Numbers" Method

Players should recruit every [](Playable_Characters.md) they can find. This method is
expensive due to hiring fees and the cost to keep characters well
equipped and fed. This method should be very effective against groups
from factions such as [Starving Bandits](Starving_Bandits.md "wikilink") or
[Rebel Farmers](Rebel_Farmers.md "wikilink"). Players should continue with
the "Retreat to Safety" method every time that a much stronger hostile
group initiates combat, however.

### The "Hit and Run" Method

This method requires relatively high athletics. Take one fighter and
engage an enemy group. When sighted, allow the bandits to get close. Try
to move around to make them form a line while they run toward you and
attack the closest bandit once. Regardless if you hit or miss, run away,
create some distance between your fighters and bandits and repeat. If
the bandit is the first one to strike you, dodge the blow by running
away a few steps, and try again. As the bandits slowly start to die off,
you might try to take on some of the last ones for a bit longer and get
some defense training. If done correctly, you can kill entire groups
with just one quick fighter regardless of skill and equipment. This is a
good but time-consuming way of training individual fighters and is often
more efficient than training dummies. Using a fast cutting weapon will
wear out the bandits quicker through bloodloss, however.

This method might be possible with several quick fighters, but
obviously, the risks for injury increase with the number of fighters
when using this method alone.

### The "Smashing Groups" Method

This tactic is useful whenever you find different groups of enemies
close to each other. For instance, a group of dust bandits could be
close to a group of hungry bandits. If this occurs, run towards one
group and then circle back towards the other. At first, both will be
trying to engage you, but if your athletics skill is high, which it
should be, you will distance yourself from the two groups. They will
then begin to attack each other until one group is left. At this point,
the group left standing will inevitably sustain injuries from the
battle. Take the rest out with your guys. From doing this, you have the
loot of two full groups of bandits.

### The "Buy an Army" Method

If you have the cats, it is easy to assemble a large, experienced army
very quickly by hiring bodyguards/cannibal hunters/mercenaries at a few
local bars, then lead them as cannon fodder into an intense fight. For
the price (generally 2,000 per day for four characters), these
disposable soldiers are valuable fighters *and* distractions.

### The "Action RPG Micromanagement" Method

Early on, combat tends to have a certain rhythm. A person gets staggered
when hit by damage beyond their toughness capacity threshold, and when
staggered, they suffer a stun of a few seconds to several seconds.
During this time, their ability to block dramatically goes down, and
they can be continuously "comboed" by several enemies in a row. An enemy
will also usually strike once, and then wait to block the
counter-attack. These timings allow the player to watch which person is
being attacked, toggle on block using a keybind (A is close enough on
ESDF key setups), wait to block the offensive from a single enemy in a
duel or multiple enemies, and then toggle off the block to
counter-attack. If your attack hits and staggers an enemy, continue the
offensive. If the enemy blocks, toggle your own block back on to get the
bonus defense. Doing this can dramatically increase the survival rate of
your light skirmishers and tanks, while still allowing them to punch
back. Even against larger animals with high attack, they may still be
able to block. This makes Kenshi more like an Action RPG, where you semi
actively use your defense and block skills. Combined with a typical
kiting strategy, this can make combat less repetitive as the combat
animations are quite good in this game.

## Clearing Ancient Locations

Ancient Locations such as [Lost Armouries](Lost_Armoury.md "wikilink") and
[Ancient Labs](Ancient_Labs.md "wikilink") often contain [](Security_Spider.md). Security Spiders can be dangerous
to take out with large groups because they can hit two characters at
once with a single attack.

### The "Lure Outside" Method:

Security Spiders will attack any characters entering their location due
to the job "Home-Territory Aggression." Characters can walk into these
locations and trigger this job and then run outside of the building. The
Spiders will be lured outside as well. Have your character continue
retreating into the wilderness until the Spider loses them or until the
Spider runs into some wildlife to initiate combat with. Unless
characters walk too close to the Spider, it will sit in place until it
finds a combatant.

An excellent way to do this with a single character is to lure all
spiders outside a distance and then backtrack to the building. As long
as they have a good lead on the Spiders, this character should be able
to close the door to the building behind them and loot the Ancient
Location without issue.

### The "Crossbow Coward" Method:

The buildings which house an Ancient Lab are designed especially for
this method. Crossbow-wielding characters should enter an Ancient Lab in
[Stealth](Stealth.md "wikilink") Mode and stop walking as soon as their eye
turns from blue to yellow. Security Spiders cannot be snuck past, so you
will always be caught. In about a second, the eye will turn from yellow
to red, and the Spider will initiate combat. Entering in Stealth Mode
this way is crucial to ensure that the character only baits a couple of
Spiders into combat, not the entire Lab worth of Spiders.

After luring the alerted Spider out into the circular porch of the
Ancient Lab, keep a safe distance from the Spider at all times.
Constantly be changing camera angles and running from the Spider in a
circle around the building. Security Spiders run at 11mph, so most
characters should be able to always keep a lead on them. To attack,
characters should stop running for a while so that they can reload their
[Crossbow](Crossbows.md "wikilink") and shoot. Spiders slow their walking
speed down just before attacking, so watch them and run as soon as they
are getting too close.

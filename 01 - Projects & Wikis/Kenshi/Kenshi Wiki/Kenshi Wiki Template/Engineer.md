The **Engineering** skill affects the time it takes to construct
buildings and objects. Constructing objects and buildings increases this
skill. The [Construction](Construction.md "wikilink") page has more
information on how the engineer skill is used in-game.

Experience for this skill can be gained by building things, repairing
buildings, and by producing [](Copper_Alloy_Plates.md) at the [](Copper_Alloy_Bench.md).

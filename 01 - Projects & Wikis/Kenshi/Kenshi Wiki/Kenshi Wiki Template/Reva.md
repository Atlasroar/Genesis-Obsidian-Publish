**Reva** is a [Unique Recruit](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink"). She is a
former [Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") citizen who was trained
by the [Flotsam Ninjas](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink") as an apprentice, but
never made it to become a 'full-fledged Paladin basher' because of her
anger issues. She refuses to be recruited by a male Greenlander, but
will join females and any other race not of "Pure Blood". She can be
hired for 6,000 Cats.

She can be found in [Flotsam Village](Flotsam_Village.md "wikilink") or
anywhere controlled by the [Flotsam Ninjas](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Flotsam_Ninjas.md "wikilink").

She has an Honorable [Personality](Personality.md "wikilink") and after
recruitment will have the "Player flotsam" Dialogue Package.

Reva shares several lines with her fellow flotsam
[Digna](Digna.md "wikilink"), most of them verbally attacking
[Griffin](Griffin.md "wikilink"), mostly over his past. She also shares
dialogue with the other Flotsam recruits, though mostly information on
the [Cannibal Plains](Cannibal_Plains.md "wikilink").

## Trivia

- Iyo appears to be hiding secrets from Finch and the Machinists as a
  whole. When questioning Iyo as a Skeleton PC, Iyo will say the
  following: *"Look, you don't need to worry... no one will ever know
  the truth. As long as I am Finch's second-in-command, I will see to
  that myself."*
- In Japanese, one possible reading of Iyo's name could
  be「葦陽」*(iyō)*, a common gender-neutral first-name.
  - Another possible interpretation is「異様」*(iyō)*, which means
    "strange", "bizarre", or "eccentric", perhaps a reference to Iyo's
    mysterious and shifty behavior.

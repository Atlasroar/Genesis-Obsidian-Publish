**Double-Barrel Harpoon Turret** is a Defence building. Players can
construct this building after researching [](Double-Barrel_Harpoon_Turret_(Tech).md). They can be
built on the ground or on top ofÂ [](Defensive_Walls.md).

The range, accuracy, and speed of a turret is modified by the operator's
related skills. The previously mentioned stats as well as the damage of
the turret is affected by the height difference between the turret and
its target. Turrets will be more effective if fired from above.

Double-Barrel Harpoon Turrets can be upgraded to Double-Barrel Harpoon
Turret \[light\] after researching [](Double-Barrel_Turret_Spotlight_Fitting_(Tech).md). The
stats for an unlighted Double-Barrel Harpoon Turret are the same as a
lighted one, disregarding the negative effects of working in darkness.

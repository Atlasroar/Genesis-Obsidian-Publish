**Crab Raiders**are soldiers of the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Crab_Raiders.md) faction. They can be found patrolling
[Crab Town](Crab_Town.md "wikilink"), [](Crab_Village.md), and other territories controlled by
the Crab Raiders, such as [Greenbeach](Greenbeach.md "wikilink"), [](Stobe's_Garden.md), [The Crags](The_Crags.md "wikilink"),
[The Pits](The_Pits.md "wikilink"), and [](The_Pits_East.md).

The deaths of [Valamon](Valamon.md "wikilink"), [](Lady_Tsugi.md), and [](Lord_Yoshinaga.md) can allow them patrol as far as
[Stormgap Coast](Stormgap_Coast.md "wikilink") and
[Heng](Heng_(Zone).md "wikilink").

They will show up to a player's outpost to host [](Crab_Tournament.md).

## Interactions

Random patrols of **Crab Raiders** can bodyguard the player for 6 hours
if they are allied.

While bodyguarding, Crab Raiders will *not* attack other wild
[Crabs](Crabs.md "wikilink"), even when they're attacking the player nor
will react if the player attacks said crabs.

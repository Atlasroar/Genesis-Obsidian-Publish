**Slave Capture** is an [Event](Events.md "wikilink") that can trigger when
recruiting an [Escaped Slave](Escaped_Slave.md "wikilink") or [](Slave_Escapee.md) via dialog, or if a visiting soldier
from the [United Cities](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink") spots an [](Slavery.md) character.

Once triggered the [Slave Traders](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Slave_Traders.md "wikilink") will send
an assault to the [Player's](Nameless.md "wikilink")
[Base](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"), this assault will
consist of 1-2 squads, each made up of 7-14 [](Slaver_Caravan_Guard.md), 0-1 [](Slaver_Heavy_Guard.md), led by a [](Slaver_Caravan_Boss.md).

When the assault arrives, the War Leader will give a short speech before
ordering the attack to begin, attacking characters and gates, and
kidnapping downed characters. Any kidnapped characters will be enslaved,
and then delivered to a slave camp.

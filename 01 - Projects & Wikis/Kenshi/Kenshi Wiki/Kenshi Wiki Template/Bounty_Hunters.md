![](bhunters.png "bhunters.png") **Bounty Hunters**are adventurers who
make their living collecting the [bounties](Bounty.md "wikilink") of
bandits, criminals, and other wanted persons. They are mostly made up of
citizens from the [United Cities](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md "wikilink"), and can
often be found in their lands or nearby areas. If bounty hunters see a
crime being committed, they may attack the perpetrator.

**Bounty Hunters** can be found in [](Watcher's_Rim.md), manning [](Harpoon_Turret.md) in a camp. Some can be talked to
about the [Bugmaster](Bugmaster.md "wikilink"), whom they are all hoping to
fight. Roaming [Bounty Hunter](Bounty_Hunter.md "wikilink") squads can also
be found in [Heng](Heng.md "wikilink"), [](Stobe's_Gamble.md), [](Stobe's_Garden.md), [](Stormgap_Coast.md) and [](The_Great_Desert.md).

Members of this faction can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached.

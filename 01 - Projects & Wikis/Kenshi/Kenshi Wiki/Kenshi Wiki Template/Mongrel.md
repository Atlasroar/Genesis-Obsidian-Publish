![](Mongrel_Map.png "Mongrel_Map.png")**Mongrel**, the sole town of the
[Mongrel faction](Mongrel_(Faction).md "wikilink"), is located in the
middle of the [Fog Islands](Fog_Islands.md "wikilink"). Due to its
location, it can be extremely dangerous to attempt to reach it. Players
may lose characters to the [Fogmen](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Fogmen.md "wikilink") on the journey if
not careful. However, once you reach the town you will be protected by
many powerful gate guards. Purchasing a **[Map](Maps.md "wikilink") to
Mongrel** prior to journey can help to stay on the right path. The town
itself has good variety of shops, many having goods not available in
[The Holy Nation](03%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"). [Beep](Beep.md "wikilink"),
[Crumblejon](Crumblejon.md "wikilink"), [](Infinite_Wingwang.md), and [Shryke](Shryke.md "wikilink")
are [Unique Recruits](Unique_Recruits.md "wikilink") found in Mongrel,
either in one of the [bars](Bar.md "wikilink") or wandering the town.

The town guards are in constant conflict with waves of Fogmen patrols
attempting to breach the gates and carry off prisoners (potentially
including the player). While the guards are powerful foes, it
nevertheless pays to be vigilant while visiting, as Fogmen sometimes
slip through the defenses.

## Tips

Care should be taken with regards to sleeping squad members as certain
Fogmen could slip through the defenses and simply pick up the resting
squad member and run off, characters cannot resist while being carried
so it would require another nearby member to take down the said Fogmen
kidnapper. [ru:Безродный (город)](ru:Безродный_(город) "wikilink")

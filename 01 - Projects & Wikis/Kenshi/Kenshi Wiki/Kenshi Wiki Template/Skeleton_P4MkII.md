![](Skeleton-P4Mk2.png "Skeleton-P4Mk2.png") The**P4 Unit MkII** is a
subrace variant of [Skeleton](Skeleton.md "wikilink"). A supposedly
'improved' variant of the [P4 Units](P4_Unit.md "wikilink"), this race is
used for the most dangerous and high leveled characters in Kenshi:
[General Hat-12](General_Hat-12.md "wikilink"), [](General_Jang.md), the [](Head_of_Agriculture.md),
[Cat-Lon](Mad_Cat-Lon.md "wikilink"), and [Ponk](Ponk.md "wikilink"). Mark II
units are more delicate models with only 150 HP in their body parts,
while most other skeleton models are more durable. They also have
different skill learning capability when compared to the standard P4
Unit, most notably replacing most of the crafting related skills to
combat skills.

Characters of this race have the body of a [](Skeleton_No-Head_MkII.md) and the head of a [](P4_Unit.md).

There are no [Playable Characters](Playable_Characters.md "wikilink")
available which belong to this race.

## Trivia

- Similar to the Mark I P4 Units, Mark IIs take up high-ranking command
  roles, while built more frail than the average skeleton. They were
  clearly destined for command far away from danger. Due to the
  surviving Mark II members roster, many in the community speculate that
  the Mark II line was a product of the Second Empire's development of
  [P4 Mark I](P4_Unit.md "wikilink"). This is however unconfirmed in-game.

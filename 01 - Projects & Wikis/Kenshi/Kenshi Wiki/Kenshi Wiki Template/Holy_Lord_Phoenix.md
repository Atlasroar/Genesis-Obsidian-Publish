**Holy Lord Phoenix** resides in [Blister Hill](Blister_Hill.md "wikilink")
in his throne room.

He has [Diplomatic Status](Diplomatic_Status.md "wikilink") and is
surrounded by his entourage that consists of 14 [](High_Paladin.md) and his personal bodyguard, the
[Protector of the Flame](Protector_of_the_Flame.md "wikilink").

He has a 100,000 cats bounty with the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/United_Cities.md) and the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md).

His home contains several of the copies of important letters ([](Letter_To_Priest_Ton.md), [](Letter_To_A_Priest.md), [](Letter_From_Bad_Teeth.md)). These items are not unique,
indicating that they were copied especially for Lord Phoenix.

This character can colour armour and clothing due to a [](Colour_Scheme.md) attached. The colour is different from
the faction's color as it is attached to this character rather than the
faction.

## Dialogue

The Holy Lord Phoenix (blessed be his name) will not talk to you if you
have not proven your worth in the eye of [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink").

When playing as a human man, the player will get a 'speech bubble' icon
when they mouse over the Holy Lord. However, if the player's relation
with The Holy Nation is not high enough, when the player goes to talk
with him, he will only respond "..." and one of his Paladins will warn:
"This, is The Lord incarnate. You will not approach without summon, my
brother. Step away from the Holy Lord Phoenix Himself, blessed be his
name." The player must have a
[relation](Guide_to_Faction_Relations.md "wikilink") of 75 or higher with
[The Holy Nation](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md "wikilink") to be able to speak with
him in the Throne Room. Once you reach 75 relations the Lord Phoenix
will give you the [Chalice Of Fire](Chalice_Of_Fire.md "wikilink") when
spoken to.

The Holy Lord Phoenix will also talk to the player if the player brings
in certain bounty targets. He will not talk to you if you are a woman
and may cause a humorous dialogue if talked to as one, or immediately
attacked by the surrounding High Paladins.

Care should be taken to not allow any non-humans to get into the throne
room, since if they are seen by the Phoenix they would be attacked even
when a human escort is nearby as it's considered a sacrilege.

If the player releases Phoenix after imprisoning him, Phoenix will mark
that this is a declaration of war and would have relation set
immediately to be hostile with [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/The_Holy_Nation.md).

Conversely, if the player releases Phoenix after being imprisoned by
others and doesn't equip any robotic limbs, Phoenix would mark that The
Holy Nation will never forget this act of savior and will have relation
be set to ally with The Holy Nation. One thing particularly noteworthy
for HN is that this dialogue of saving him and having an alliance with
HN can happen despite being a non-Human or a woman. If the player
releases Phoenix while having robotic limbs in this scenario, there will
be no relation changes.

## History

![](Lord_Phoenix.jpg "Lord_Phoenix.jpg") **Phoenix LXII**, blessed be
his name, is the leader of the [Holy Nation](Holy_Nation.md "wikilink"),
the 62nd Phoenix in an [](Lineage_of_Phoenixes.md) of reincarnated Lawgivers. The
Lawgiver is said to be the messenger of [Okran](Okran.md "wikilink"), the
chosen saviour who once unshackled men from a savage life to a holy
purpose under the law of god. On Phoenix I’s deathbed he announced that
he would be reborn again into the body of the next first born male, and
his descendants have directly enforced ‘Okran’s will’ ever since.

In particular, the Holy Lord Phoenix LXII, is one of the harshest in the
line of the Phoenixes. Brought up and indoctrinated in isolation during
the whole of his childhood, he was burdened with the responsibility of
judging his own family at the young age of 16. He sentenced them to be
purged in the Divine Flame and has unrelentingly cast the judgement of
Okran ever since.

## [World States](World_States.md "wikilink")

The death or kidnapping of the **Phoenix** causes several different
changes, most of these also asking for the world states of
[Seta](High_Inquisitor_Seta.md "wikilink") and
[Valtena](High_Inquisitor_Valtena.md "wikilink").

Primarily, Blister Hill will become destroyed, or if both Seta and
Valtena are also dead/imprisoned, will be handed over to the Flotsam
Ninjas if [Moll](Moll.md "wikilink") is alive, or to the [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Holy_Nation_Outlaws.md) otherwise.
[Rebirth](Rebirth.md "wikilink") follows the same pattern.

The various [Holy Mines](Holy_Mines.md "wikilink") and [](Holy_Farms.md) change ownership as well.

If [Bad Teeth](Bad_Teeth.md "wikilink") is under HN control, it will become
half-destroyed after his death/imprisonment.

[Holy Military Bases](Holy_Military_Base.md "wikilink") will become
destroyed and turn into [](Deadhive_Overrun.md).

[Fogman Nest Invasion](Fog_Deathyard.md "wikilink") will also start in
[Okran's Gulf](Okran's_Gulf.md "wikilink").

The Phoenix's death or kidnapping also causes some of the
[Paladin](Paladin.md "wikilink") and [Inquisitor](Inquisitor.md "wikilink")
roaming squads to stop spawning, while [](Kral's_Chosen_(Character).md) (if [](Flying_Bull.md) is alive) and [](Hundred_Guardian.md) will start patrolling HN
territories.

If a player has an [outpost](Guide_to_Building_an_Outpost.md "wikilink"),
the death or kidnapping of the Phoenix will prompt several raids to
begin, primarily a [Wrath of God](Wrath_of_God.md "wikilink"). Berserkers
will also start raiding the "holy-dog slayer". The [](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Band_of_Bones.md) [Raid](Raid.md "wikilink") on the player
outpost will, however, stop.

The death of the Phoenix and his High Inquisitors will also finally
prompt several dialogue lines from your characters upon entering HN
territories. [Shek Kingdom](02%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Shek_Kingdom.md "wikilink") Sheks will also
comment on your achievement, as well as prompting an alliance with Shek
if [Bayan](Bayan.md "wikilink") and [](Esata_the_Stone_Golem.md) are spoken to.

## Bounty

If Holy Lord Phoenix is turned in to the following factions it will
grant the following benefits/penalties:

### Shek Kingdom

- -75 relations with The Holy Nation
- +70 relations with Shek Kingdom
- 100,000 cats bounty reward

  Shek Kingdom

### United Cities

- -75 relations with The Holy Nation
- +60 relations with United Cities
- 100,000 cats bounty reward

## Trivia

- Holy Lord Phoenix gives great big bear hugs, and smells of
  vegetables.[^1]
- He appears to be dismayed when you bring [Longen](Longen.md "wikilink")
  to him.
- If Seto is brought before Holy Lord Phoenix he will call her the devil
  child, and claim that he plans to have her purged in a ritual and sent
  to Okran, likely meaning he is going to have her burned at the stake.

**Animals**are characters in Kenshi which are not humanoid. This
category includes robotic animals, as they are categorized as animals in
[FCS](Forgotten_Construction_Set.md "wikilink") and function the same in
game.

Animals are separated into two categories: [Fauna](Fauna.md "wikilink") and
[Robots](Robots.md "wikilink"). Animal characters may also belong to the
following [Characters](:Category:Characters "wikilink") subcategories.

### [[Category - Playable]]

These animals are purchasable from specific animal traders. More
information on this can be found on [](Guide_to_Animals.md).

### [Unique](:Category:Unique "wikilink")

These characters only die once. If left alive after a fight, they can
regain their health when the player reloads their location. These
animals typically contain items which are exclusive to them.

This subcategory is not exclusive to characters and may contain some
[Unique Items](Unique_Items.md "wikilink"). __NOEDITSECTION__

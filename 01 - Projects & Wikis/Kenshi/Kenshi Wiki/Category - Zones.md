This category contains pages on the Zones of Kenshi. In FCS, these zones
are in the category "Spawn Area". To decrease confusion between Zones
and [Environment](Environment.md "wikilink"), the word "biome" is not used.

There is another 'Zone' simply titled **NONE** in-game which encompasses
a large portion of the game's coast, and the outside areas of the
Ashlands. This 'zone' has no resources, homeless spawns, or nests.

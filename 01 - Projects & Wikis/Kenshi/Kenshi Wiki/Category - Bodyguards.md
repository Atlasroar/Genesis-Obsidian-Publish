Bodyguards are allied characters that under certain conditions assist
your player characters or guard your outpost from enemies. They will
only guard your character or outpost for a certain amount of time until
they return to their patrol or home. Bodyguard contracts appear
under right side of the Factions window under
[Events](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Events.md "wikilink").

These characters appear as green on the map.

This category includes allied patrols that join you, mercenaries hired
to defend your outpost. It does not include the slaves and prisoners
that you free, pets accompanying the allied patrols, or allied
reinforcements in response to raids.

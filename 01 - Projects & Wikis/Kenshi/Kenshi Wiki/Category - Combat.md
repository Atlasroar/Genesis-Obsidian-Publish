Combat is a primary part of Kenshi, and all combat is done with weapons.
Weapons are [items](http://kenshi.wikia.com/wiki/Items) that are split
into multiple categories, each dealing different types and amounts of
damage. [Armour](http://kenshi.wikia.com/wiki/Armour) is designed to
reduce damage, and can be bypassed by using certain weapons. Weapons and
Armour can be purchased from [Traders](Traders.md "wikilink") . See the
guides for more details on fighting.

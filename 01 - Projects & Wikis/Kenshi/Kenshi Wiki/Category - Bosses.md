__NOTOC__

**Boss** characters are [characters](:Category:Characters "wikilink")
who lead or hold a leadership role in a '[](Factions.md). They are usually differentiated by higher
quality [armor](Armour.md "wikilink"), [Weapons](Weapons.md "wikilink"), and
[stats](Statistics.md "wikilink"), and some will carry
[Meitou](Meitou.md "wikilink") weapons.

Killing or capturing a Boss character will change the world's story, and
thus change the [world states](World_States.md "wikilink"). All of the boss
characters listed in this category will influence world
states.<noinclude>

Most Boss characters are also *Unique*, though this is not *strictly*
true. [The Red Sabre Boss](Red_Sabre_Boss.md "wikilink"), [](Lord_Mirage.md), and a handful of others are not marked
as unique - potentially by mistake.

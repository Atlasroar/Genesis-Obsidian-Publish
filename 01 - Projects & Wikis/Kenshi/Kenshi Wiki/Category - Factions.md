![](93_factions.png "93_factions.png") This page lists all pages in the
factions category. For an entry detailing Kenshi's factions press
[here](Factions.md "wikilink").

There are several different **factions** you can join and fight against
in the game. Some factions will be
[hostile](Hostile_Factions.md "wikilink") to any person they see, such as
the [Cannibals](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Cannibals.md "wikilink"),
[Berserkers](01%20-%20Projects%20&%20Wikis/Kenshi/Kenshi%20Wiki/Kenshi%20Wiki%20Template/Berserkers.md "wikilink") and [](Swamp_Ninjas.md).

The different factions can wage war against one another, so be careful
with who you choose to side.

By attacking a faction, you may become an enemy of that faction for some
time. Some factions have methods to repair
[relations](Guide_to_Faction_Relations.md "wikilink"), but most do not. So
pick your battles wisely.

To make a character invisible, just turn all mesh faces inside out
(flip).

Uses for invisible characters

- A phantom leader can lead cavalry units without being seen (patrol
  function requires a leader and that to work the leader cannot be
  carried)
- You can make ghosts (although you cannot have them wear visible
  clothes, it seems)
- A NPC can serve as an interactive console or device

These are the three currently known methods to claim a town for the
player faction.
Do note that it was never intended for the player to gain ownership of
towns, so all these are cheats and may cause unforeseen problems. Also,
this is a "good" way to avoid raids, as the raiders get confused where
your outpost is if you build another one besides the town.

See also [Changing Town Ownership](Changing_Town_Ownership.md "wikilink")

### Option 1: Mods

Fe. 'Take Over the World' allows you to fight for the ownership of a
town.

### Option 2: Using the ingame editor:

1.  Go to town you want to claim.
2.  Open ingame editor with "shift + F12".
3.  Select Town Placement and search for the name of the town you are
    in.
4.  Click on the name of the town you are in and then the town marker
    statue should vanish.
5.  Find "Your outpost" in the town placement menu and place it where
    the old town marker was.
6.  Save and reload the save so that changes are applied.

Do note, that if the town marker change is not saved to a mod, it is
very likely next time you import the town ownership goes back to
original owner. Best used in unison with Option 3.

### Option 3: FCS or save editing: [Save Editing 101 By Shidan](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1370334383)

1.  Open FCS and create a new mod.
2.  Find the town you wish to own (in "Towns") and open its file.
3.  Change the faction ownership to the player faction (Nameless). Don't
    forget to remove that previous owner.
4.  Save the mod and load it next time you launch the game.

There is talk on [](Changing_Town_Ownership.md) that doing this without
removing the old town marker will result to two markers in the town,
which may cause more issues. So you should do this in unison of Option
2.

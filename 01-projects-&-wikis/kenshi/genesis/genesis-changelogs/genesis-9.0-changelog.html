<li data-line="0">-adjusted the swamp "vines" again. Reduced them again to a density of 1. this should allow them to sparingly spawn but should improve load times, as well as navmesh.</li>
<li data-line="1">-removed the shek ranch on the edge of vain north of admag. caused loading loops of all assets in the area which caused huge loading spikes. It will be moved further west.</li>
<li data-line="2">-moved all hive buildings EXCEPT the hive robotics into the hive category.</li>
<li data-line="3">-adjusted farming in dreg. there is now a farming rank of 10% green and 10% water. THe area is slightly richer in iron (by 5%). This should allow players to base their now and live naturally without outright being forced to rely on hydroponics. You'll just require MUCH more farms and wells.</li>
<li data-line="4">-adjusted and changed all western hiver villages (i think). since all hive villages share the same template this allowed for very easy and different village looks. some are heavily guarded, some are just farmers, others will be a mix of all of the above.</li>
<li data-line="5">-all western hive villages can now spawn with mercs "recruit variant",</li>
<li data-line="6">-all hive villages will spawn with hive caravans that travel from town to town. this should allow those who live in the area to trade much more easily as well as slightly increase the chance to have hivers show up to your base in the area as well as other towns.</li>
<li data-line="7">-hiver villages now have a police station. it's aptly named "justice station".</li>
<li data-line="8">-hiver villages are now decently lit (through torches and lanterns)</li>
<li data-line="9">-upgraded the "distant" hive villages. the one in sinkuun is much more city like and the one in the great desert is a little larger. Due to their general proximity to other factions you'll find more bar squads, more traders and more roaming squads for them in the areas they are in (spawning from their villages)</li>
<li data-line="10">-made a custom "worker" stat package. they'll average 15-20 combat stats but will have 100 in farming and labor this should make them able to produce much more stuff (like they should if they just work their whole damn life). This'll have a couple benefits of them being able to curb players "taking" from farms. Has been added to western hive drones and generic NPC's</li>
<li data-line="11">-started changing the adventurers guild rally points. Instead of tiny platforms they'll now be solo shacks. This should completely eliminate the "permanent" spawned campaings from them as well as allowing some other benefits.</li>
<li data-line="12">-deleted the (HH) hat variants. Without knowing what they are MEANT to look like i'd rather avoid the obscene texture and mesh tearing that happens when NPC's wear them.</li>
<li data-line="13">-updated string. Now only includes the wayfarers bar and various bar residents</li>
<li data-line="14">-updated brink town utilities are outside of the city. Plenty of stuff outside the city. though the wells are far away from the city</li>
<li data-line="15">-brink is now a sizeable village and not a full city. Though due to it's size it has no houses for sale.</li>
<li data-line="16">-touched up black scratch (still waiting on some assets to touch up the great library)</li>
<li data-line="17">-moved and remade moon cultist village. Removed the external buildings. Now everyone live in the giant pyramid.</li>
<li data-line="18">-added a legal system to the skeletons. They now properly have a legal system which will make them punish thieves</li>
<li data-line="19">-changed the iron mine 1/2 to now act like the copper mine does. Given it's primitive tech it will work slower than normally and require more laborers but it works based off stone. So it should be somewhat easier to farm resources in areas with high stone but less resources of other types. (you can now use the stone/copper/iron mines as low tech alternatives to farm from stone the proper resource you may need in an area that is lacking it)</li>
<li data-line="20">-removed black beards gully and compressed it into his fort.</li>
<li data-line="21">-moved black beards fort. Look to the sea to find it.</li>
<li data-line="22">-moved and rebuilt all of tortuga.</li>
<li data-line="23">-removed a bunch of the inter factions in tortuga. The NPC's should fight much less.</li>
<li data-line="24">-removed all residents and replaced with the generic and squatter lists</li>
<li data-line="25">-figured out and fixed the loading issue surrounding the city of todai dera.</li>
<li data-line="26">-added a new more generous resource spawn type for farming based off the mountains in stobes garden. Playing mountain top monks should be friendlier.</li>
<li data-line="27">-changed the interior of the smugglers bar</li>
<li data-line="28">-added more bar squads to the smugglers bar</li>
<li data-line="29">-adjusted the pathing around the smugglers bar to fix an issue seen in @KevWasHere video series</li>
<li data-line="30">-added a town generator to the last waystation as described by @pattmaster</li>
<li data-line="31">-locked squad sizes of citizens (They won't randomize or grow through setting changes)</li>
<li data-line="32">-randomized the sohei wandering squad more. Renamed them to samurai as well. This should cause a "trickled" lore effect. Samurais will have various weapons and gear exclusive to them. This should also allow a nice blend of armors in the area AND as they are traveling around without them being bright red/blue beacons.</li>
<li data-line="33">-removed small barrels</li>
<li data-line="34">-removed booze barrels</li>
<li data-line="35">-removed booze barrel</li>
<li data-line="36">-removed "five" booze barrels</li>
<li data-line="37">-removed armour storage (small metal chest)</li>
<li data-line="38">-removed food stores (greyish barrel)</li>
<li data-line="39">-removed large basket</li>
<li data-line="40">-removed small crate (small box)</li>
<li data-line="41">-deleted booze barrel table</li>
<li data-line="42">-updated the grey desert waystation. It's now using the waystation four name. it's also been moved slightly south west. it's been completely overhauled.</li>
<li data-line="43">-updated old village</li>
<li data-line="44">-renamed south stone camp to "Grind stone"</li>
<li data-line="45">-upgraded slave farm N</li>
<li data-line="46">-adjusted sheer cliff to be more ruin like</li>
<li data-line="47">-renamed "the groggery" to Semolina.</li>
<li data-line="48">Semolina is the coarse, purified wheat middlings (intermediate milling stage) of durum wheat mainly used in making couscous, pasta, and sweet puddings.</li>
<li data-line="49">-deleted crab villages</li>
<li data-line="50">-deleted shipwright village (it's been merged into tortuga)</li>
<li data-line="51">-rebuilt grogery</li>
<li data-line="52">-hated the new grand bazaar so much i yeeted it and the new manhunter base only to move the bazaar into the wetlands (the sole trade center there, north of clownsteady) and reverted the manhunters base to it's original shape and size just with more buildings</li>
<li data-line="53">-removed and replaced the hasher faction</li>
<li data-line="54">-removed the clowns faction</li>
<li data-line="55">-added more vendors of various factions to the bazaar</li>
<li data-line="56">-renamed the grand bazaar to "Carsi". Carsi in turkish means "market". more or less.</li>
<li data-line="57">-overhauled and rebuilt catun from scratch to fix dozens of issues. Lore related and gameplay related.</li>
<li data-line="58">-remerged the updated CM-Roads &amp; CM-roads-ADDON pack to include and optimize the new stuff added and updated.</li>
<li data-line="59">-updated the icons and stuff for fogmen to use the new version from fog hunt.</li>
<li data-line="60">-replaced the pathing for item dependencies to reference the already included work from camels mods.</li>
<li data-line="61">-noticed an error with severed hive limbs. Renamed and repathed all of them</li>
<li data-line="62">-made a polish pass on swordran with some of the new assets. replaced the old bar with the new bar1 setup.</li>
<li data-line="63">-pulled a bunch of the city of swordran (resident hourses) inside it's walls. this should make it less likely citizens will pull grievewraiths into the city.</li>
<li data-line="64">-rebuilt a bunch of the navmesh and tweaked the road and pathing in and around the city, the new road assets allow straight vertical drops through built in stairs which allows less models to be rendered. TLDR: no more long ramps to gain elevation.</li>
<li data-line="65">-Reduced the amount of citizens and houses in the city of swordran. Much more condensed and lighter on performance.</li>
<li data-line="66">-added a new copy of the low arid resources. bumped the farming height by 200. (this should allow basically everywhere around the main castle to be farmable)</li>
<li data-line="67">-cleaned up a leftover town from the great shun purge</li>
<li data-line="68">-tweaked 42 sections of the shun road network (a lot of it runs through water alonside the banks of the rivers, i just pulled the road out of the river areas)</li>
<li data-line="69">-added two new forks in the shun road networks. should cull travel time across the region when traveling long distance.</li>
<li data-line="70">-removed the roaming squads from swordran and added them as bar squads. this ensures they will spawn and will patrol</li>
<li data-line="71">-adjusted the gate guard squad. added a squad 2, added rangers to both squads, added more relevant medical items to all tertius guards</li>
<li data-line="72">-adjusted the patrol squads size</li>
<li data-line="73">-new holy nation start was added and expanded upon with the HN redux merge.</li>
<li data-line="74">-renamed holy hessian uniform (from HN redux) to Holy Hessian Pants - Padded</li>
<li data-line="75">-renamed Stout Hessian pants (vanilla) To Holy Hessian Pants</li>
<li data-line="76">-changed "sacred rags" to &gt; Holy Hessian Skirt</li>
<li data-line="77">-edited all cannibals to now carry less armor (% wise) certain types like tenderizers/leaders etc will still wear armor in full force. this should slightly tweak cannibals back to relying on numbers and their many new various weapon setups.</li>
<li data-line="78">-edited many cannibals of "lower" orders to carry the new weapons.</li>
<li data-line="79">-many cannibals have been adjusted to be more or less prevalent in certain areas.</li>
<li data-line="80">-added new cannibal spawns to create infighting in the area</li>
<li data-line="81">-culled the new "cannibal" squads to be smaller to ensure a lively north but not massive loot everywhere.</li>
<li data-line="82">-removed cogs crow nest and merged it into gearcove</li>
<li data-line="83">-rebuilt gearcove. it's more compact....but it's also, so damn cool. had a lot of fun with this hidden ruin design.</li>
<li data-line="84">cleaned up remaining locations of dyers guild towns. they'll be added back in on player request to existing towns.</li>
<li data-line="85">-made most of the volcanos around spring completely accesible. they're a little small but can provide some nice looking bases should players wish. (edit: Look for bridges/ramps going up the volcanos)</li>
<li data-line="86">-upped the skeleton bandits limb qualities. i noticed that with the addition of the skeleton limbs they tended to be much much weaker than they were meant to be. I also balanced their stats to be flat. 45 &gt; combat instead of 42.</li>
<li data-line="87">-added more limb variations to skeleton bandits. some at lower quality and some at higher. this should provide a decent fight every time as the limbs mix to create different stats</li>
<li data-line="88">-fixed the floating sign in flats lagoon under the platform as pointed out by @Mobile Kek Suit</li>
<li data-line="89">-rebuilt the fishing platforms from scratch. should now much better reflect the people living there. Made a duplicate generic fisherman (from the deadcat people). They'll now roam around or spawn at fishing platforms whereever they may be. they now appropriately wear the new fishing gear by cat</li>
<li data-line="90">-after a day or so of crashing fixed an error with the pathing for the new fishermans gear. Changed the items from "shirts" to "body" armor. Removed the shirt texture layer to prevent a black body.</li>
<li data-line="91">-fixed the bob haircut. A texture channel was wrong. which caused flickering on a bunch of other hairs when GPU was even slightly strained. Mesh and texture now show correctly. mind you. this wont solve the texture flickering. Unsure at this time what causes it but this change seems to lessen the problem significantly</li>
<li data-line="92">-After 4 days of consistent crashing, having to force quit, and trying to manually rebuild the entirety of the navmesh in and around mongrel. I said F this. Rebuilt the entirety of mongrel. Which allowed for a slight style change in walls and utilities. The town is a sizeable bit smaller too. Much closer to it's vanilla counterpart with a little more love in the design than before. While simpler i stuck to the last versions design choices.</li>
<li data-line="93">-The road network in and around mongrel was overhauled. There's less branching paths to nowhere and most of the road network loops back into itself. This should make auto pathing a little more consistent.</li>
<li data-line="94">-caught a texture crash as a result of the texture pathing of the simpler mills. fixed now.</li>
<li data-line="95">-Made a secondary pass around the fog islands. Upped the nest spawns from 0 to 3. This should reintroduce a number of fogmen spawns and randomize them a little bit</li>
<li data-line="96">-upped the number of homeless squads from 3 - 10, reduce the scavenger homeless spawn to a weight of 1, upped the spawn of praetorian squads to a weight of 10,</li>
<li data-line="97">-adjusted the range of mongrel as a town.</li>
<li data-line="98">-removed two static deathyards right next to mongrel. this caused a "dead" loop with other towns in the area in which roaming and "bar" squads would no longer spawn.</li>
<li data-line="99">-upped the roaming squad and bar squad counts for the death yards. decreased them for the nest spawns.</li>
<li data-line="100">-increased the weight of the slough hyenas spawning in the area.</li>
<li data-line="101">-added some debris to the static deathyards. should be plenty of bones and bit laying around.</li>
<li data-line="102">-dropped the max altitude by 200 for boneyard spawns. increased the max slope, increased the building density. With these adjustments it's probably around...20%-ish more common now to find them. (though with the max slop increase they can be harder to reach now)</li>
<li data-line="103">-for those aware of it. changed the input/output and operators of the ancient forge. it is no longer automated. it also needs 5 people to craft anything. needs tech 6. it needs 50 old cpus per "item". Hunger rate is set to 3.5. Will probably be ramped up even more in the future.</li>
<li data-line="104">-Added loot randomization to fogmen nests and the static deathyards.</li>
<li data-line="105">-changed the nest spawned deathyards to have much more condensed "buildings". they'll spawn less in a wide range and closer to the center of the nest.</li>
<li data-line="106">-Moved Stone camp south. Thus creating a logical trail of "slaves" and caravans from south to north. stone camp is now situated directly south of stoat. who's main focus as redesigned is a "slavers trading grounds"</li>
<li data-line="107">-made some minor tweaks to the cactus den. tightened up the "town" so it now has an even smaller range and impact. removed some of the lighting in the town to make it much less obvious from a distance.</li>
<li data-line="108">-tweaked fort mirage. reduced the radius, removed the foliage range. moved the city up on top of the hill, added some more power, upped the squad count, removed the randomization with player settings,</li>
<li data-line="109">-renamed stone camp to wrought. Wrought is now a heavy industry iron mine for the UC</li>
<li data-line="110">-moved port south to the hook. it's now situated in between drifters last and clownsteady to fill in the crucial gap of "slavers" in the area.</li>
<li data-line="111">-adjusted the roads around port south to now travel across a bridge</li>
<li data-line="112">-pulled all of the road networks in the hook out of water unless there is very little of it at depth. this should allow npcs and players to travel easier through and across the map in the area.</li>
<li data-line="113">-deleted mechamoor</li>
<li data-line="114">-deleted the bonepile</li>
<li data-line="115">-deleted gale</li>
<li data-line="116">-cleared some of the bottom floor of the "trashed" outpost interior. Purged all guard nodes except from the bottom floor. Great white gorillo should now only roam a very tiny area on the bottom floor. This will prevent him from despawning, or getting stuck. He will still however try to chase you throughout the building. As such i've also cleared much of the interior or pushed all the trashed items into larger piles.</li>
<li data-line="117">-cleaned up all of mourn. removed some exterior items to reduce loading, removed and condensed some housing. replaced some squads and fleshed out many others. there should now be less infighting however many NPC's have "rebel/outlaw/drifter" dialouge. so they'll complain and make snarky comments and threaten each other.</li>
<li data-line="118">-adjusted the guards for the gates and replaced the ai with the new genesis package. this should somewhat save mourn from issues as the ai will now purge bodies and heal each other and the city</li>
<li data-line="119">-deleted lycus</li>
<li data-line="120">-simplified how the bonefield bandits will work. Players will start off either allying or fighting the bonepack. When the leader is dead the marrows will move in, when the marrows leader is dead the gutter gang will move in. Once all bosses are dead, the factions will dissapear and the outpost will turn into a smugglers den. Each leader killed will wipe out their faction. Each leader has unique rewards. The factions will be common as homeless/nest squads until their leader and base is wiped out.</li>
<li data-line="121">-cage has been overhauled to be much much simpler and cleaner.</li>
<li data-line="122">-polished up the bonepacks clothing, weapon and dog selection.</li>
<li data-line="123">-cleaned up the gutter gang, and the marrows bandit squads.</li>
<li data-line="124">-adjusted the worldstates for CAGE to now stack. One must happen before the other to ensure no bugs.</li>
<li data-line="125">-adjusted the stats and weapons of all bandit groups. they're now much weaker. but still decently balanced around being "mid game" bosses.</li>
<li data-line="126">-removed most crossbows and turrets from cage squads.</li>
<li data-line="127">-removed beak things from gutter gang squads, they now only have a town spawn (for dead bodies)</li>
<li data-line="128">-adjusted the relations between gutters and gutter gang to 100 for both. this should avoid them killing each other.</li>
<li data-line="129">-overhauled lure, gale was semi compressed into it. (one shelter). The town now has a MUCH smaller footprint. The questline will be rewritten to accommodate the sacred band quest. this will give life to part of the south eastern world lore. it'll also help polish up some Holy nation world lore through the interactions with the sacred band and why they are leading the fish islanders</li>
<li data-line="130">-activated distant mesh for all towns.</li>
<li data-line="131">-removed ronin weapons BP from all squads, added back to seth</li>
<li data-line="132">-cleaned out vendors who sold ronin weapons, as previously discussed on discord they're now sold at market vendors</li>
<li data-line="133">-Deleted the dialogue causing the "..." elipsis problem</li>
<li data-line="134">-Removed the floating light from skinners roam as reported by @Master-chan</li>
<li data-line="135">-made a pass on the ark reaver HQ it should have a proper generated navmesh now</li>
<li data-line="136">-changed scraphouse respawn to 1 week</li>
<li data-line="137">-deleted hope (haha no hope, go fuck yourself)</li>
<li data-line="138">-fixed the tree in urusai as pointed out by @Mak</li>
<li data-line="139">-fixed two scraphouse placement bugs where furniture was inside of other furniture as pointed out by @Master-chan</li>
<li data-line="140">-changed dack and quin to unique as pointed out by @shade0180</li>
<li data-line="141">-deleted the wool cap as reported by @Lenin's Cat to avoid the graphical errors it causes</li>
<li data-line="142">-cut the verglas hound scale down from 1.2 to 1 even</li>
<li data-line="143">-fixed cannibal lord weapon manufacturer levels</li>
<li data-line="144">-removed the item called "tech" as reported by @HorHorHor</li>
<li data-line="145">-fixed brood town area</li>
<li data-line="146">-deleted the cannibal minion</li>
<li data-line="147">-renamed some cannibals from more serious names to more inline with what they appear to be in lore, new spiky and meat beater cannibals</li>
<li data-line="148">-started working on okrans shield, overhauled how all squads work so that all HN citizens are easy to identify. Each church now has it's own guards and staff with unique armor sets. The military now has exact and cleaned up roles.</li>
<li data-line="149">-overhauled bad teeth, refreshed the city design to be cleaner and replaced all the unique squads with generic squads</li>
<li data-line="150">-overhauled stack, refreshed the city design</li>
<li data-line="151">-added a new holy church sign mesh for the......churches from @Boron</li>
<li data-line="152">-replaced genesis tengus palace with the vanilla tengus palace, thus fixing the crossbow level bug @Master-chan noticed</li>
<li data-line="153">-fixed the minor housing issues in squin</li>
<li data-line="154">-finished up the adjustments on squin, squin now uses it's vertical height a lot more for the town to flesh it out and fill it up</li>
<li data-line="155">-overhauled vainspass and moved it father into vain. Reworked the entire city to be much cleaner.</li>
<li data-line="156">-moved stenn desert waystation farther south</li>
<li data-line="157">-moved and rebuilt berserker village south</li>

<li data-line="164">-added restful base props (the rest of the mod) by snugsnug</li>
<li data-line="165">-added buildings mod by snugsnug</li>
<li data-line="166">-added stowage packs mod (by snug - unreleased public)</li>
<li data-line="167">-per request of @Para added and increased the sniper spawn rates in sniper valley. Now holding a 70% weight to spawn two per zone is roughly a 30% chance. and roughly 50% chance to spawn one alone. added skeleton limbs to them as well thus further randomizing their skill levels.</li>
<li data-line="168">-reorganized the categories and sub categories of a couple hundred items again. condensed even further into cleaner categories</li>
<li data-line="169">-merged workbench variations. Mod allows players to upgrade many storage options into 2nd and 3rd tiers. It also randomizes its look for many benches while overhauling many generic storage objects so that players can visually identify whats inside common vanilla barrels. Like greenfruit sitting on top of a greenfruit storage barrel. Iron ore being in iron ore storage.</li>
<li data-line="170">-added snugsnug weapon mod. it added in some holy nation weapons and civilian weapons left out from earlier phases of genesis.</li>
<li data-line="171">-reduced the nest spawns in the hook</li>
<li data-line="172">-adjusted the homeless spawns to be much smaller in grouping.</li>

<li data-line="198">-rebuilt sanctuary from scratch and buffed it a bit</li>
<li data-line="199">-added in building replacements for UC, they now can spawn sohei houses (storm house &amp; small shack) in towns. This provides a mix of buildings as would be indicated by their standing in the world.</li>
<li data-line="200">-added building replacements for shek. They now replace storm houses. Giving shek a rustic and beaten town life.</li>
<li data-line="201">-changed some world features around squin. It now looks like its spawned in a canyon overhung by rocks. (Tldr: a cave).</li>
<li data-line="202">-overhauled western hive capital with new hive assets.</li>

<li data-line="205">-noticed on stream that the storehouse was pulling to much resource time. Rebuilt its interior with the new assets and cleaned up its interior</li>
<li data-line="206">-sanctuary now provides mercs and traders for players in the area. This follows suit with adding more random bar squads to populate the world while traveling.</li>
<li data-line="207">-adjusted naming conventions of categories. Following suit with other categories all furniture is now in town - interior, all roads and such are now in town - exterior. Walls are now under town - walls. Thus grouping major categories into a hanful of main titles. Buildings, town (decorations &amp; additions like roads and bridges, furniture), crafting, farming, camping, &amp; tech.

</ul></div><div><p>-Ruins will now fall into one of 4 categories.</p></div><div><p>--Ruins. In general these wont be very desirable except in the early game. Players will generally be able to tell what these are by the fact they hold collapsed ruins and the loot is strewn about.</p></div><div><p>--Lost.

Hosting harder enemies guarding more desirable wealth and items. Maps for these come with warnings and are expensive.</p></div><div><p>--Vaults.

<li data-line="72">-added zagan back in. Zagan now hangs out around squin. You need 100k to unlock his recruitment dialogue (on you) and then you need 80+ relations with the SHEK to recruit him. Otherwise you're just an arrogant ass who thought you could challenge him.</li>
<li data-line="73">-moved vault 1 to iron trail</li>

<li data-line="79">-added more residents to the vault 2 resident list to reward players who seek out this vault.</li>
<li data-line="80">-fixed a western hiver raid bug that @OmegaXII and @KySoto pointed out</li>
<li data-line="81">-fixed a southern hiver raid bug in vains pass that was noticed while testing the western hiver raid bug.</li>
<li data-line="82">-Reduced the chance of crossbows for slaver caravan guards as reported by @KySoto this should make crossbows a bit rarer for them to carry but still possible. added the tooth pick to their repitoire and removed the three shot ranger. They still have the ranger.</li>
<li data-line="83">-fixed a flipped gate in mourn.</li>
<li data-line="84">-fixed a interior issue with no lights in the hive justice spire.</li>
<li data-line="85">-fixed the shinobi smuggler dialogue as pointed out by @Cirdanoth . the rank is now properly detected.</li>
<li data-line="86">-fixed the weapons in the western hive exiles start. fixed the squad spawns as well. Modified the start to now put you at -10 with the western hive.</li>

<li data-line="91">-adjusted the weights of crab limbs and their quality on crab raiders as noticed by @Keywee They should spawn rarer on most of the crab raiders excluding the crab raider captains. The quality chance has been lowered across the board. Also added custom stats to the crab raiders and captains. Making them tankier and slower. Adjusted the weapon spawns to now almost fully use the crab maul and the crab vairant of the man slayer.</li>
<li data-line="92">-overhauled the grid. added more gates and added old machine spawns to them.</li>
<li data-line="93">-added 5 post ancient workshops which now spawn a wealth of engineering research</li>
<li data-line="94">-added skeleton legion patrols to the grid.</li>

<li data-line="100">-fixed the traders guild not having any cats to trade with or buy player items with.</li>
<li data-line="101">-compressed the ancient tech lab into the "lab". will now serve as a template for ruins</li>
<li data-line="102">-cleaned up some left over towns (again) from cheaters run.</li>
<li data-line="103">-RE-rebalanced All Backpacks. Smaller bags now provide benefits, or no negatives (gear dependent), Medium Size Bags have slight negatives, large backpacks even more so and "trader" bags or otherwise Massive bags generally have huge penalties that make them a high price for combat.</li>
<li data-line="104">-Animal bags now have obvious bonuses. Smaller animals will get 100% weight reduction but they also can barely hold enough food. Mid animals (goats/anetelopes) are fast but only get a 90% reduction in weight. Bulls/Garru/Skimmers all get the same exact bag bonuses, so you can pick your favorite pack animal. Cage Beasts Now get 100% reduction and have a larger inventory and stack 20x20.</li>
<li data-line="105">-The changes to all bags will push players out of their comfort zone, paired with the eventual Speed changes in the Genesis mod for all races this should push players to use "trade" animals more and "trade" bags less unless they can overcompensate for the detriments of the new stats.</li>
<li data-line="106">-Thanks to @DreXav for the bug reports on the bags beta</li>
<li data-line="107">-Thanks to @Ranger|.\ for the updated info on the bags.</li>
